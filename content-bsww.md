> sectionId: section-1
> id: step-1

Chinese New Year is the most important festival for Chinese people all over the world. It is also called the Spring Festival or the [__Lunar__](gloss:lunar) New Year. 

The [__exact__](gloss:exact) date of the Spring Festival on the Western [__calendar__](gloss:calendar) changes from year to year. 

However, Chinese New Year takes place between January 1 and February 19. 

On the Chinese calendar every year has an animal's name. 

These animals are the rat, [__ox__](gloss:ox), tiger, [__rabbit__](gloss:rabbit), dragon, snake, horse, [__ram__](gloss:ram), monkey, [__rooster__](gloss:rooster), dog and pig. 

A Chinese [__legend__](gloss:legend) says that these twelve animals had a race. The first year was [__named after__](gloss:name-after) the [__rat__](gloss:rat), the winner. 

The other eleven years were named according to the order in which the animals arrived in the race. 

The clever rat jumped onto the ox's back, and then at the end jumped over the ox's head to arrive first! 

The Chinese believe that a person born in a [__particular__](gloss:particular) year has some of the [__characteristics__](gloss:characteristic) of that animal.

## Rain, Rain, Go Away（Nursery Rhyme）

> sectionId: section-10
> id: step-10

Rain, rain, go away, 

Come again another day. 

Rain, rain, go to Spain, 

Never show your face again. 

Rain, rain, pour down, 

But not a drop on our town. 

Rain on the green grass, 

And rain on the tree, 

And rain on the housetop, 

But not on me. 

Rain, rain, go away, 

Come again on washing day. 

Rain, rain, go to Germany, 

And [__remain__](gloss:remain) there [__permanently__](gloss:permanently). 

Rain, rain, go away, 

Come on Martha's wedding day.
