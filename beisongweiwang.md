1 Chinese New Year

Chinese New Year is the most important festival for Chinese people all over the world. It is also called the Spring Festival or the Lunar New Year. 
The exact date of the Spring Festival on the Western calendar changes from year to year. However, Chinese New Year takes place between January 1 and February 19. 
On the Chinese calendar every year has an animal's name. These animals are the rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, ram, monkey, rooster, dog and pig. A Chinese legend says that these twelve animals had a race. The first year was named after the rat, the winner. The other eleven years were named according to the order in which the animals arrived in the race. The clever rat jumped onto the ox's back, and then at the end jumped over the ox's head to arrive first! 
The Chinese believe that a person born in a particular year has some of the characteristics of that animal.

春 节
对于全世界的华人来说，中国的新年是最重要的节日。人们也称它为春节或农历新年。 公历春节的确切日期每年都在变化。但是春节一般都在 1 月 1 日 到 2 月 19 日 之间。 在农历中，每年都有一个生肖。这些生肖是鼠、牛、虎、兔、龙、蛇、马、羊、猴、鸡、狗和猪。据传说，这十二个动物举行了一次赛跑，第一年就以获胜者鼠命名，其他十一年就根据动物们到达终点的顺序命名。聪明的鼠跳在牛背上，在最后时刻跳过牛的头顶第一个到达终点！
中国人相信在某一年出生的人具有这一年生肖的一些特征。

My school had a policy about homework. Students should not spend more than ninety minutes per night doing homework. This is how I use the time for my work. 
Fifteen minutes looking for assignment; Eleven minutes calling a friend for the assignment; Twenty three minutes explaining why the teacher is mean and does not like teenagers; Eight minutes in the bathroom; Ten minutes getting a snack; Seven minutes checking the TV Guide;    
    Six minutes telling my parents that the teacher never explained the assignment; 
Ten minutes sitting at the kitchen table waiting for Mom or Dad to do the assignment.

有关青少年的一则笑话——做作业的指导方针
我的学校有一项针对作业的政策。学生每天晚上做作业的时间不应该超过九十分钟。
以下就是我如何为完成作业而使用这九十分钟的。 
花十五分钟找作业；花十一分钟打电话向同学问作业； 
花二十三分 钟抱怨 老师为什么总是那么讨厌，为什么不喜欢我们这些十几岁的孩子； 
花八分钟在洗手间里；花十分钟找小吃； 
花七分钟查看电视节目预告；花六分钟告诉父母，老师从没解释过所布置的作业； 
花十分钟坐在餐桌旁等妈妈或者爸爸来做作业。


3 The Toad and the Frog

A toad saw a frog near the road. He was a fat old frog. He sat and moaned and groaned. 
The toad said, “Do not moan and groan, Mr. Frog. Hop like me. Hop down the road.” 
So the frog and the toad went down the road to a big oak tree. 
“I am home,” said the toad. “Come in and I will make tea.” 
But Mr. Frog said, in a deep croak, “I must not roam far from home. I will be off to my home near the pond.”

癞蛤蟆和青蛙
一只癞蛤蟆在路边看到一只青蛙。那是只又胖又老的青蛙。他坐在那里呻吟叹息着。 
癞蛤蟆说：“青蛙先生，不要呻吟叹息了。像我一样跳吧。沿着这条路跳。” 
所以青蛙和癞蛤蟆一起沿着小路跳到一棵大橡树下。 
“我到家了，”癞蛤蟆说，“进来吧，我来泡茶。” 
但青蛙用低沉的声音说：“我不能在离家远的地方闲逛，我要回我在池塘边上的家。”

5 Homestay in the US

    My name is Jenny and I did a homestay in America. When I first met my host mother, Mary, she gave me a big hug. I was really shocked because I had never been hugged before, and I wasn sure how to respond. By the time I left America, though, I came to enjoy hugging and being hugged. Shaking hands was also a challenge. My homestay father, Peter, looked at me straight in the eye and squeezed my hand firmly. 
    Both Mary and Peter wanted me to call them by their first names because they, as Americans, like informality. By using first names only, we felt friendlier towards each other.

在美国家庭寄宿 
我叫珍妮，我在美国家庭寄宿。当我第一次见到我要寄宿那家的母亲玛丽时，她热情地拥抱了我。我确实感到非常震惊因为我从来没有被拥抱过，我不知道该如何回应。然而到我要离开美国时，我已经非常喜欢拥抱别人和被别人拥抱了。 
握手也是个挑战。我寄宿那家的父亲彼特，直视着我的眼睛，紧紧地握我的手。 
玛丽和彼特都希望我对他们直呼其名，因为美国人一般比较随意。通过直呼其名，我们互相之间感到更加亲切友好。


6 Brothers and Sisters

    My sister is a year older than me and we've been sharing a room since I was 3 years old. We are very close, but we also fight all the time. Our fights are never serious. I can't remember the cause of our fights now, but they were always over small things. Sometimes it was just over a particular word I used or maybe just because my sister gave my teddy bear a hug and I was unhappy about it. We don't take our fights very seriously as if all the fights are a game. I think it's perfectly okay for kids to fight with their brothers or sisters. Now I'm a teenager, and I even think that they're sweet memories!

兄 弟 姐 妹 
我的姐姐比我大一岁，从我三岁起我们就一直合用一个房间。我们非常亲密，但是我们也时常打架。我们打架从来不是认真的。我现在都记不起我们打架的原因，但肯定是因为一些小事。有时候，仅仅是因为我用的某个词，或者是因为姐姐抱了我的玩具熊，而我对此感到生气。我们从来不把打架当真，就好像这只是场游戏。我觉得小孩子和兄弟姐妹们打打闹闹没有什么。现在我已经十几岁了，但我觉得那都是我美好的回忆！

9 A Visit to the City Centre

    On their first day in the capital, Diana and Peter visited the Old Tower which stood on a hill near the city centre. There were stairs leading to the top, but Diana and Peter decided to take the lift. At the top there was a caf?and a balcony where visitors could stand and enjoy the view. It was magnificent — you could see the whole city, the river and the hills beyond. 
    On their way back from the Tower, Diana and Peter went past the main square in the city centre. They stopped at a stall to have some orange juice, and sat and watched the traffic for a while. The square was very busy, with cars, buses, bicycles and pedestrians going in all directions. In the centre of the square there was a policeman controlling the traffic.

在从古塔回来的路上，戴安娜和彼特游览了市中心广场。他们在一个小摊贩前停下喝果汁，坐下小歇一会，观赏街上的车水马龙，广场上小汽车、公共汽车、自行车和行人络绎不绝，广场中心一位警察在指挥交通。


10 Rain, Rain, Go Away（Nursery Rhyme）

Come again another day.

And rain on the tree, 
And rain on the housetop, 
But not on me.

Come again on washing day.

And remain there permanently.

Come on Martha's wedding day.

雨下在碧绿的草地上，雨下在树上，雨下在房顶上，但不要下在我身上。 
雨，雨，走开吧，洗衣服的那天再来吧。 
雨，雨，去德国吧，永远待在那里吧

13 Dogs

    People often say that a dog is man's best friend. Over thousands of years, man has taught his dogs to do many kinds of work besides guarding the home. For example, sheepdogs are famous for their ability to control a flock of hundreds of sheep. 
    Dogs have been used to aid disabled people for centuries. A guide dog can lead its blind owner. Nowadays, dogs can be taught to turn on light switches, open refrigerator doors and dial the telephone for their disabled owners. For the majority of people, however, dogs are simply pets and friends for both young and old members of the family.

Eventually, a painter comes. He is confident that he can mix the proper colour. The woman is pleased with the result, and the painter becomes famous.

17 A Barbecue

When I was a child, I once went camping with my family in the summer. We decided to make a barbecue in the valley. So we collected some tree sticks to make a fire. My father asked me if I could try to make a fire. I was glad to take the job. Then I tried to set fire to the wood with a match, but produced only smoke. Then my father said, "That's not the right way. I'll show you how to do it. First use the small pieces of wood because they catch fire easily. Then put the larger ones on top of them."My father helped me make a big fire.

18 A Joke— “I stand corrected”

I have this friend who always seemed to lean slightly to the left all the time. It used to bother me, so I suggested he see a doctor, and have his legs checked out. For years, he refused and told me I was crazy, but last week, he finally went. Sure enough, the doctor discovered his left leg was a quarter inch shorter than his right. A quick bit of surgery later, he was cured, and both legs are exactly the same length now, and he no longer leans. “So,”I said, "You didn't believe me when I told you a doctor could fix your leg. He just looked at me and said, "I stand corrected.

19 Making a Kite

One day, Paula and Richard decided to make a kite. First they went out and found two straight sticks of the same length. They brought them back home and tied them with a piece of string into the shape of a cross. Then they took some string and used it to tie the four ends of the sticks together. Then, they spread some brightly coloured paper over the frame and glued it around the string. They stuck a tail made of paper to one of the corners, and tied a long string to the centre of the kite. On the next windy day, they took the kite to a hill near their house and flew it.

20 Animals in Danger

Some of the animals and birds in the rainforest, such as monkeys and woodpeckers, live in the treetops. They are always swinging and flying from one tree to another looking for food among the leaves and branches. They even sleep in the treetops so they do not have to come down to the ground. Have you heard that such animals and birds in the rainforests are in danger? 
Because people are cutting down so many trees in the forests, the animals are losing their homes. Do you know the reasons for it? Yes, people want wood, paper and land. As a result many animals and plants are dying. Some forests are so badly damaged that they become deserts.

一些雨林中的动物和鸟类生活在树顶上，例如猴子和啄木鸟。它们总是从一棵树荡到或飞到另一棵树上，在树叶和树枝间寻找食物。它们甚至在树顶睡觉，所以它们不用到地面上来。 
你知道吗？雨林中的这些动物正处于危险中。因为人们砍伐了森林中的许多树，动物们失去了家园。你知道人们砍树的原因吗？是的，人们需要木材、纸和土地。所以，许多动物和植物正在消亡。一些森林遭到了严重的破坏，变成了沙漠。


21 English in the World 

    Some people say that the English language no longer belongs to the English, and it belongs to the world. It is estimated that the number of people who use English exceeds 750 million. Among these, about 350 million are native speakers, while the rest use it as an official language. If we add to this number the people who have acquired the language to some extent, the total is close to one billion. 
    English plays an increasingly important role in the world as a medium for conducting international business and diplomacy, as well as in science and medicine, the Internet, air and sea communications, international sports events, radio and TV programs, pop songs and movies.

英语，作为进行国际业务和外交的工具，在世界上起着越来越重要的作用。它还在科学、医药、互联网、空中及海洋通信、国际体育赛事、电台电视节目、流行歌曲及电影中发挥着越来越重要的作用。


22 A Friend

    When you read an English book, you often come across new words. You might try to guess what the words mean from the words you know, but when you cannot guess the meanings of new words at all, what should you do? You have a good friend then. From him you can learn what a word means, how to pronounce a word, how to use a word, and so on. This friend can always be with you, and you can always ask him to help you. Do you know who this friend is? It is a dictionary. You can learn some important things about words from it, so you must know how to use it.

他就是字典。你可以从他那里学习有关词汇的众多重要知识，所以你必须学会如何使用字典。


23 “I Have Never Heard You in Carmen”

    Mark Twain was once invited by a friend to go to the opera. The friend was very rich. He and his wife had their own box at the theatre. During the opera the friend's wife talked all the time. She also talked rather loudly. She talked so much that it was often difficult for Mark Twain to listen to the opera. Toward the end of the opera she turned to Mark Twain and said, "Oh, my dear Mark Twain, I do want you to be with us again next Friday night. I'm sure you will like it — the opera will be Carmen." "Thank you very much,"said Mark Twain. "That will be fine. I have never heard you in Carmen."

歌剧临近结束时，她转而对马克?吐温说：“噢，我亲爱的马克?吐温，我真的想让你再和我们一起度过下周五。我保证你会喜欢的——下周的歌剧是《卡门》。” 
“非常感谢，”马克?吐温说。“想来会很好。我还从未听过你唱《卡门》。”


24 Learning English in England

    I came to England last summer. I have been in England for eleven months. I am going to finish my studies in England soon, and will leave for China next month. At first it was very difficult for me to communicate with other people in English. Now I can speak English much better, and even understand English television, because I have studied hard and my teachers and classmates have helped me a lot. I have lots of English friends now. Some of them have even invited me for dinner at their houses. They are interested to learn about China and Chinese people. Every time they ask me a lot of questions, I realize how little I know about my own country. 
communicate 交流

在英国学英语
去年夏天，我来到英国。现在我在英国已经待了十一个月了。我将很快结束在英国的学习，下个月我就将回中国了。 
一开始，我觉得很难用英语和别人交流。现在我英语说得好多了，甚至可以看懂英语电视，这是因为我学习很努力，老师和同学对我的帮助也很大。现在我有许多英国朋友。一些朋友甚至邀请我去他们家吃饭。他们对中国和中国人很感兴趣。每当他们问我许多问题时，我才意识到自己对祖国的了解是如此之少。

    One day a hare was telling the other animals how fast he could run. "I can beat anyone!"cried he. "Will one of you try a race with me?""I will,?said the tortoise. "You!?laughed the hare. "Oh, oh, how funny!?"Save your laughing for the end of the race,?said the tortoise. 
    So a starting line was made, and away they went. The hare ran fast and was soon far ahead, so he sat down to rest. By the time the tortoise came up, the hare was sleeping. On and on went the tortoise, and when the hare looked up at last, it was too 
late. There sat the tortoise by the sign that said: The End.

兔子和乌龟
一天，兔子正在向其他动物炫耀他能跑得很快。“我能跑过任何人。”他喊道。 
“你们有谁想和我比一比吗？” “我。”乌龟说。 “你！”兔子笑道，“哦，哦，太滑稽了！” “留着到比赛结束后笑吧。”乌龟说。 
他们划了条起跑线，出发了。兔子跑得飞快，很快就跑到了前面，所以他坐下来休息。等到乌龟赶上来时，他睡着了。 
乌龟一直往前走，当兔子最后醒来时，已经太晚了。 乌龟坐在一块牌子旁，上面写着： 终点。


26 Helping Parents 

Parents often get angry because of their trouble in their lives. Let's say that your mother is not happy about her boss. If she doesn't have other ways of expressing her emotions, she might come home and yell at you, scream at your dad, kick at the dog, or even say something mean to you. 
Here's how to handle it when an adult in your life has trouble controlling his or her anger: Don't make it worse. Angry people can have trouble thinking clearly, so try not to do or say anything to make things worse. Wait till your parent cools off, then talk to him or her in a calm tone, and try to explain how the anger is affecting you. 

yell 大叫，呼喊    scream 尖声喊叫   handle 处理    adult 成年人 
cool off 平静下来    tone 语气    affect 影响 

帮 助 父 母
父母常常因为他们生活中的烦恼而生气。我们举个例子，比如你妈妈对她的上司不满。假如她没有其他方法发泄她的情绪，她就可能回到家冲你大声嚷嚷，对你爸爸大喊大叫，踢家里的狗，或者甚至对你说一些难听的话。 
当你身边的大人控制不住他们的怒火时，你应付的方法是：别让情况变得更糟糕。生气的人很难保持思维清晰，所以不要做，也不要说任何会使事情变得更糟的事或话。先等你的父母平静下来，然后再心平气和地和他们谈，并想办法说明他们的怒火是如何影响你的。

31 A Young Pioneer 
Long ago, when the western part of the United States was still a wilderness, a young boy, called Kit, not yet twenty years old, went from his home in the East to learn about the new country. He wanted to know what lay beyond the Rocky Mountains. Kit's father had taught him to shoot straight, but he learned more about hunting and trapping in the country of the Indians. Kit was always calm in times of danger. He was strong and brave. Most of the Indians liked and respected him for his honesty. For many years, Kit lived in the West. He taught other white men many things. Probably the most important thing he taught them was how to get along with the Indians.

33 The Eagle and the Raven

An eagle was trying to break open a nut in his beak when a raven landed on a branch beside him. The raven eyed the nut hopefully, "You'll never break it like that,"he said. "If I were you I would fly up in the sky as high as I could, then drop the nut onto the rocks. It's the only way you'll get at the kernel."
The eagle flew up into the sky, then let the nut fall down, down, down to the ground. The raven hopped quickly from his branch and seized the nut in his beak. By the time the eagle had found his way back to the right place, all that was left was a broken piece of shell.

鹰飞向空中，然后让坚果落下，落下，落到地面。渡鸦飞快地跳离树干，叼住了坚果。当鹰寻旧路折回时，地上只剩下一些破碎的果壳了。

35 A Bus Ride 

One day I was on a bus. I found an elderly woman standing in front of me. She had a big bag in her hand. "It's a virtue for a young person to help the old,"I said to myself. When I was standing up to give my seat to the old lady, a young foreigner got 
up quickly saying, "Please sit down."The old lady thanked him and sat down. She looked very happy. I was a little embarrassed because I was sitting in the middle of the bus. Suddenly a pregnant woman got onto the bus. I quickly stood up to give up my seat to her. The foreigner smiled at me. He said that he was an Australian, and was a student studying Chinese culture in China.

36 The Dog and His Shadow

It happened that a dog had some meat that he wanted to eat at home. On his way home he met a river. As he looked down, he saw his shadow in the water. "Just look!"said he to himself. "That dog down there has some meat, too. If I could get it away from him, I would really eat well tonight!"With this thought, he made a snap at the other dog's meat. And as he did, his own meat fell into the water. So then he had nothing at all. Then he saw that the other dog had lost his meat, too. "That is as it should be!?thought he. "For I saw him trying to take my meat away from me."By wanting to have everything, he has lost everything he had! 

shadow 影子   snap at 抓，咬

狗和他的影子
碰巧狗有一些肉，他想回到家后再吃。回家的路上，他遇到了一条河。当他往河里看
时，在水里他看到了他的影子。 
“看啊！”他对自己说，“下面的那只狗也有一些肉。如果我能从他那里把肉弄过来，
那我今晚就可以美餐一顿了！” 
带着这个想法，他朝另一只狗的肉扑去。当他这么做时，他自己的肉掉进了水里。所以
他就什么都没有了。 
然后，他看到另一只狗的肉也没了。“活该！”他想，“因为我看到他想从我这里抢走
我的肉。” 什么都想要，却失去了原来所拥有的！


37 Managing Your Emotions

What makes me angry? Mostly, I hate when someone tries to make someone else feel bad. I have to admit that once, when I was really angry, I actually called names. I regretted doing this afterwards, but not full heartedly because I think I was provoked in that situation.The most positive way of dealing with anger is talking about the problem. I talk to someone who listens, or I'll write my thoughts down on paper. Learning how to deal with anger as you're growing up is so important. When you're younger, you might yell, or cry when you're angry, but as you get older, you're expected to handle your emotions much better. Learning to control your emotion now will prevent you from doing something that you'll regret later on in life! 

emotion 情绪   manage 控制，操纵，管理   admit 承认 
full heartedly 全心全意地   provoke 激怒   prevent 预防，防止

控制你的情绪
什么事会让我愤怒呢？通常情况下，当有人试图使别人觉得不舒服时，我会非常愤怒。我不得不承认，有一次，在我实在很生气的时候，我确实骂了人。过后，我很后悔那么做，但我不认为全是我的错，因为我觉得在那种情况下，我是被激怒了。 
解决愤怒的最积极的方法是把问题说出来。我说给愿意听的人，或者把我的想法写在纸上。在你成长的过程中，学会处理愤怒是非常重要的。小时候，你生气的时候可以大喊大叫或者哭闹，但长大后，你被期望能更好地控制情绪。 
现在就学着控制情绪能让你避免做一些可能使你以后遗憾一生的事情。


38 “I Don’t Have to Eat All the Egg.”

A lady once wrote a long story. She sent it to a famous editor. After a few weeks the story was returned to her. The lady was angry. She wrote to the editor: 
"Dear Sir: Yesterday you sent back a story of mine. How do you know that the story is not good? You did not read it. Before I sent you the story, I pasted together pages 18, 19 and 20. This was a test to see whether you would read the story. When the story came back yesterday, the pages were still pasted together. Is this the way you read all the stories that are sent to you?"The editor wrote back: "Dear Madam: At breakfast when I open an egg I don't have to eat all the egg to discover that it is bad.?

editor 编辑   paste 用浆糊粘

“我不必吃掉整个鸡蛋。”
曾经有位女士，她写了一篇很长的小说，并把它寄给了一位著名的编辑。几周后小说退回来了。女士很生气，她给编辑写了封信。 
“尊敬的编辑先生： 
昨天你把我的小说退回来了。你怎么知道这小说不好？你根本没有读过。在寄给你之前，我把十八、十九和二十页粘在了一起。这是要检查你是否会读我写的小说。昨天小说退回来时，这三页还粘在一起。难道这就是你阅读所有寄给你的作品的方式吗？” 
编辑回信写道：“尊敬的女士： 早餐时我打开一只鸡蛋，我不必等到吃完整个鸡蛋后才发现蛋是臭的。”


39 Visiting Shakespeare’s Home 

In 1998, when I was working for an export company, I went to England. After finishing my business, which took several days, I went to Stratford, where Shakespeare was born. In Stratford, I visited several sites that are associated with Shakespeare, including the house where he was born, the church where he was buried, and the cottage where his wife's family lived. I wanted to see a play, so I asked at the theatre box office for whatever tickets were available. I got a seat for The Merchant of Venice, which is my favourite play. Afterwards, I waited at the stage door for my favourite actor, who was in the play. I got his autograph and talked to him. It is an experience that I will remember forever.

我想去看一出戏剧，所以就向剧院售票处询问哪场戏剧有票，结果买到了《威尼斯商人》的票，这是我最喜欢的戏剧。之后，我在后台入口处等到了剧中我最喜欢的演员。我得到了他的亲笔签名并和他交谈。这次经历我永远不会忘记。


40 A Thrilling Ride

Bill and Jane were coasting on a hill. Down the hill went the sled. Bill steered. Jane held on tightly. The coasters on the hill watched them. Past trees they whizzed. Jane yelled, "Stop the sled! Stop the sled!?but Bill could not stop it. 

Suddenly Jane had a feeling that she was a bird in flight. Was she dreaming? She landed in a big pile of snow. Where was Bill? He must have gone all the way down the long slide to the end of the hill. Now, Bill came in sight plodding up the hill. Jane laughed as she called to him. They were so glad to be together. The coasters cheered to see them safe. They went home to tell Mother what a thrilling ride they had had.

41 Saving the Earth

One day, I went with the group to a nearby river. We wanted to check if it was clean. We did many scientific tests to see if the river was healthy. Surprisingly, it was! We still, though, took any rubbish we could find out of the river. We wanted to make sure fish could live there happily. Recently, I helped the group plant flowers at our school. We're hoping the flowers will bloom this spring and make the school look beautiful. How did we pay for all the plants? We made T-shirts and sold them to our friends! We're still got some money left from selling the T-shirts. We hope to use it to buy some recycling bins for the school.

最近，我和小组的其他人一起在学校里种了一些花。我们希望今年春天这些花会开，把学校装点得更美丽。我们怎么会有买这些植物的钱呢？我们自己做T恤衫，然后卖给我们的朋友！我们还剩余了一些卖T恤衫得来的钱。我们希望可以用这些钱为学校购买一些废物回收箱。


42 Two Goats on the Bridge

One day a goat started to cross a little bridge. At that very minute, another goat started out from the other side of the bridge. 
When they saw one another, they knew that one of them would have to go back. "Go back!?cried the first goat. "Where is no room for you to pass here while I am crossing.""It is you who must go back!?cried the other goat. "You can start again after 
I cross over.?The first goat said as he was in the right and would not give way. "We will see!"cried the other goat, and they started to fight. In another minute, the two goats fell into the water. A man who was fishing saw the fight. He laughed as he pulled the goats out of the water. "You see,?said he. "When everyone thinks he is right, something always goes wrong!"

“我过去以后你再开始过。”第一只羊说。他觉得自己是对的，所以他不肯让路。 “我们走着瞧！”另一只山羊喊道，然后他们开始打起来。 很快，两只羊都掉到了水里。 
一个正在钓鱼的人看到了这场争斗。他笑着把山羊从水里拉了出来。 “你们看，”他说，“当每个人都觉得自己是正确的时候，就一定会出事！”

In China, there are many different kinds of food. Some of them are very popular. Dumplings are real Chinese food.Everyone in China likes dumplings very much, and there are many different kinds of dumplings. Some have meat and vegetables in them and others have sugar, eggs and other tasty things. I like dumplings with vegetables and pork better than any other kind. Usually people make dumplings at home. If you have no time to make them, you can buy them in supermarkets. Then you take them home, heat them up and eat them with vinegar. The Spring Festival is very important in China. During the Spring Festival, we make dumplings. Usually we put a coin in one dumpling. If you eat the dumpling with the coin in it, you will be very lucky in the year.

45 In a Strange City

    If you go out by yourself in a strange city, you might get lost. What should you do? How can you find your way? Of course, if you never go out alone, you won't get lost, but you will also miss a lot of good experiences. One thing you can do in case you get lost is take a map along. It might also be a good idea to take a card from your hotel, so you have the hotel's address. If the map doesn's help you, or if you forget to take one, you must ask how to get where you're going. You can ask, for example, "There is Nova Hotel?'or "How do I get to Nova Hotel?"or "Do you know where Nova Hotel is?"Police officers and clerks in shops are often helpful when you ask directions. 

get lost 迷路   experience 经历   in case 如果，万一

在一个陌生的城市里
如果你在陌生的城市里一个人出去走走，你可能会迷路。那你该怎么办呢？你该如何找到路呢？当然，如果你从来不独自出门，你不会迷路，但是你将会错过许多很好的经历。 
为了防止迷路，你能做的一件事就是随身携带一份地图。随身带一张酒店的卡片也是个好主意，这样你就知道酒店的地址了。如果地图帮不了你，或者你忘记带地图了，你必须向他人问路。例如，你可以问“Nova酒店在哪里？”或者问“我该怎么走才能到Nova酒店？”或者问“您知道Nova酒店在哪里吗？”当你要问路时，警察或商店的店员通常会帮助你。


46 Body Language

    If you can speak English, you know a lot of English words. You can read, speak and understand. But there is another kind of language you need to know — the language of the body. 
    All over the world, people "talk?with their hands, with their heads, and with their eyes. When Japanese people meet, they bow. When Indians meet, they put their hands together. When British and American people meet someone for the first time, they shake hands. They do not usually shake hands with people they know well. Women sometimes kiss their women friends, and men kiss women friends (on the cheek only). When a man meets a man friend, he just smiles, and says "Hello? Men do not kiss each other, or hold hands. Even fathers and sons do not often kiss each other. 

身 体 语 言
即使你会说英语，你知道很多英文单词，你会读，会说，能听懂，但还有另外一种语言你需要了解——那就是身体语言。 
在全世界，人们都用他们的手、头和眼睛“说话”。当日本人见面时，他们相互鞠躬。印度人见面时他们双手合十。 
当英国人和美国人第一次和别人见面时，他们互相握手。通常，他们不和熟悉的人握手。女人有时亲吻她们的女性朋友，男人也会亲吻女性朋友（只亲脸颊）。当男人见到男性朋友时，他只微笑着说声“你好”。男人之间不会互相亲吻或牵手。即使是父子之间也不会经常亲吻对方。


47 Little Blue Flower

    Sky Chief was a brave Indian chief. All his people loved him. He had a little niece, Blue Flower. She looked just like her name. Her eyes were as blue as the sky. Her hair was black and shiny, and it waved in the wind like the tall prairie grass. She could run like a deer, and she loved all the animals of the forest. 
    Blue Flower had a pet fawn. They played in the fields in the warm summer. She made wreaths of daisies for her pet. They had fun in the snow in the cold winter. 
    Sky Chief admired his little niece very much. On cold winter evenings, he told her stories about the stars and how they got in the sky. He told her of the Sun God and the Rain God, too. Little Blue Flower was a very happy girl and she made all the others around her happy as well.

49 Who’s Clever?

A university professor made experiments with several kinds of animals. He hoped to know which animal was the cleverest. He found out it was the monkey. In one experiment the professor put a monkey in a room with several small boxes. Some boxes were inside other boxes. One small box had some food inside it. The professor wanted to watch the monkey and find out how long it would take the monkey to find the food.The professor left the room. He waited a few minutes outside the door. Then he kneeled down and put his eye to the keyhole. What did he see? To his surprise he found himself looking directly into the eyes of the monkey. The monkey was on the other side of the door, looking at the professor through the keyhole.

50 At the Zoo

    David's family visited the zoo on Sunday. They paid five dollars for the family ticket at the gate. And then they joined the crowds flocking toward the cages. "We must watch the big animals first,?said the father. "Feeding time is three o'lock.?
    "Let's look at the birds first,?said Susan. "Some of the parrots can talk very well.?Soon they came to the birdhouse, and the first bird they saw was talking. Then they moved through the house, and came to a lake. David said, "Those big white birds in the water have such long necks. Look how gracefully they swim.
    In the next house, a great roar told them that they had been lucky enough to arrive at feeding time. As they went in, they saw tigers and lions were howling because they were hungry. "We'll see how they eat,?said father.

在第二座屋子里，巨大的吼叫声告诉他们，他们很幸运，能在喂食时间到达这里。他们进去时，看到老虎和狮子因为饿了正在吼叫。“我们来看看他们是怎么吃东西的。”父亲说。

53 Dreams by Langston Hughes

Frozen with snow .

54 Growing Tomatoes

    "I'll tell you how to grow tomatoes, Jerry,?said Mrs. Hawkins. "First dig up an area in a sunny spot in your yard. Mix in manure or compost to enrich the soil.?
    "When the danger of frost is past, which is about the first of April in this part of the country, I buy eight tomato plants from a nursery. That's enough for my husband and myself. You will probably want to buy twelve plants for your family."Lay out the plants in their cardboard container about 18 to 20 inches apart. Dig a hole deep enough to cover each pot, put the pot in the hole, cover it with soil, and pat the earth down firmly. Then pound in 4 to 5 foot long stakes next to each plant. Water the plants well. By the middle of July you should begin to have ripe tomatoes to eat.

种西红柿
“杰瑞，我来告诉你怎么种西红柿。”霍金斯太太说，“先在你院子里阳光充足的地方开垦一块地。把肥料或混合肥料混在土里使土壤肥沃。” 
“霜冻的危险过去后，在这个地区大约是在四月一日左右，我从苗圃买八棵西红柿苗。这对我和我丈夫来说足够了。你可能要给你家买十二棵。” 
“把苗放在它们的硬纸罐里，间隔大约十八到二十英寸。挖个洞，要足够深，能盖住每个罐子，把罐子放进洞里，用土盖住，把土往下拍结实。然后把四到五英尺的树桩埋在每棵苗旁边。给苗浇足水。等到七月中旬，你就应该有成熟的西红柿吃了。”


55 What’s the Hurry? Here’s Your Hat! 

    I have a friend who has a large police dog called Jack. Police dogs are often very intelligent. Every Sunday afternoon my friend takes Jack for a long walk in the park. Jack likes these long walks in the park very much. 
    One Sunday afternoon a young man came to visit my friend. He stayed a long time. He talked and talked. Soon it was time for my friend to take Jack for his walk. But the visitor still stayed. Jack became very worried about his walk in the park. He walked around the room several times and then sat down directly in front of the visitor and looked at him. But the visitor paid no attention. He continued talking. Finally Jack could stand it no longer. He went out of the room and came back a few minutes later. He sat down again in front of the visitor but this time he held the visitor's hat in his mouth. 

intelligent 聪明的, 伶俐的   stand 忍受

急什么呀？给你的帽子！

我有个朋友，他有只叫做杰克的大警犬。警犬一般都很聪明。每个周日下午，我的朋友都要带杰克到公园里遛很长的路。杰克非常喜欢公园里这种长距离的散步。 
一个周日下午，有个年轻人去拜访我的朋友。他呆了很长时间，聊了又聊。很快，我的朋友带杰克遛弯的时间到了。但客人还不走。杰克很担心公园散步不能成行。它围着房间转了好几圈，然后径直坐在客人的面前看着他。 
但是客人没有注意到。他继续喋喋不休地说个不停。最后，杰克再也无法忍受了。它跑出房间，几分钟后又跑了回来。它又在客人面前坐了下来，不过这次它嘴里叼着客人的帽子。

My dear Mother, why do you always look tired? 
If I were a spirit, I'd bring you a bunch of roses 
And drown your fatigue in their sweet scent. 
My dear Mother, why is it always hard for you to sleep? 
If I were a sleeping pill, I'd fall into your water glass and accompany you 
throughout the night.

59 Swimming

When I was a boy, I liked swimming very much. Once my two brothers and I spent 
the summer holidays with my uncle and aunt in their house by the sea. It was 
only twenty meters from the water. Every day we put on our swimming shorts 
before breakfast, ran down to the sea across the sand and jumped in. From then 
until late at night, we were in the sea or on the beach most of the time. When 
our aunt rang a bell, we went back to the house for food, but we ate it in our 
swimming shorts and were soon back in the sea again. 
The water was warm, the sun shone everyday, and on most days there were no 
waves. In the middle of the day a wind always began to blow but it was not 
strong and did not make the sea rough. 

swimming shorts 游泳裤    ring a bell 按铃，鸣钟    rough （海水、风雨等）汹涌的，狂暴的 

游 泳
当我还是个小男孩时，我非常喜欢游泳。有一次，我和两个兄弟到我叔叔和婶婶海边的
家里过暑假。从家里到海边只有二十米远。每天早饭前，我们穿上游泳裤，穿过沙滩，跑
到海边跳进水里。从那时一直到晚上的大部分时间，我们都是在海里或沙滩上度过的。当
婶婶摇铃时，我们跑回屋里吃东西，但是我们穿着游泳裤吃，吃完很快又回到海里。 
海水很暖和，阳光每天都很灿烂，多数日子里，海上很平静。每到中午时，风就开始刮
起来，但是不很大，不会使大海变得波涛汹涌。


60 The Crow and the Pitcher

    A thirsty crow once came upon a pitcher with very little water in it. Try as he would, he could get no water, for it was too far down in the pitcher. "I must find a way to get this water,"thought the crow. "I am too thirsty to go away without it."Just then the crow saw a pebble beside the pitcher, and it gave him an idea. 
    He picked up the pebble and dropped it into the pitcher. Then, one by one, he picked up more pebbles and dropped them into the pitcher. Every time a pebble fell into the water, the water rose a little. At last the water came up far enough for the crow to get all he wanted. "That just goes to show,"said the wise old bird, as he helped himself to the water, "Where there is a will, there is a way."

crow 乌鸦    pitcher （带柄和大口的）大水罐   pebble 小鹅卵石   will 意志，决心 

乌鸦和水罐
一只口渴的乌鸦碰巧遇到一只大水罐，里面只有一点点水。 无论他怎么想办法，他都喝不到水，因为水在罐子底部，太深了。“我一定要想办法喝到水。”乌鸦想。 
“我太渴了，我不能不喝水就走了。”就在这时，乌鸦看到水罐旁边有块小鹅卵石，这让他想到一个主意。 他捡起石头，把它放进水罐里。 
然后，一块接着一块，他捡了更多的鹅卵石扔进水罐里。 每次一块石头掉进水里，水就上升一点。 
最后，水上升到足够的高度，让乌鸦能喝到水了。“那正说明，”当这只年老英明的乌鸦帮他自己喝到水后，说，“有志者事竟成。”


61 Watching a Show

    The circus finally arrived in the town. Dad booked tickets for the first show on Thursday evening, which was the only show for which he could easily make himself free. The family arrived at the show and was in their seats in good time. Dad sat on a seat next to the aisle, with Mary two seats away next to Mother. 
    Then, with a blare of trumpets and a banging of drums, the show began. For the next two hours there were up-turned faces and gasps of astonishment, roars of laughter as water splashed about and balloons popped. People laughed and clapped their hands as the horses and the lion tamer performed. The show was over after two hours. "Which did you like best?"asked the mother as they made their way home. "Oh, the dogs"act,"cried Mary. "I had no idea that they could be so clever.

接着，随着刺耳的喇叭声和鼓的重击声，演出开始了。接下来的两个小时里，那里有仰面大笑，惊讶的喘息声，以及水花四溅和气球爆裂时的哄堂大笑。当驯马和驯狮者表演时，人们笑着拍手鼓掌。 
两个小时后表演结束了。“你最喜欢什么表演？”回家的路上，妈妈问。“哦，狗的表演。”玛丽叫起来，“我以前从不知道它们会这么聪明。”


62 A Useful Lesson

    In England nobody under the age of 18 is allowed to drink in a bar. Mr. Thompson used to go to a bar near his house quite often, but he never took his son, Tom, because he was too young. Then when Tom had his eighteenth birthday, Mr. Thompson took him to his usual bar for the first time. They drank for half an hour, and then Mr. Thompson said to his son, "Dow, Tom, I want to teach you a useful lesson. You must always be careful not to drink too much.""How do you know when you've had enough?"asked Tom. 
    "Well, I'll tell you. Do you see those two lights at the end of the bar? When they seem to have become four, you've had enough and should go home.""But, Dad,"said Tom, "I can only see one light at the end of the bar."

一堂有用的课
在英国，十八岁以下的人不允许在酒吧里喝酒。汤姆森先生以前经常去他家附近的一家
酒吧喝酒，但是他从来不带他的儿子汤姆去，因为他还太小。 
当汤姆过十八岁生日时，汤姆森先生第一次把儿子带到了他常去的那家酒吧。 他们喝了半小时的酒后，汤姆森对儿子说， 
“汤姆，现在我想给你上有用的一课。你必须时刻小心，不要喝得太多。” “你怎么知道你已经喝得差不多了呢？”汤姆问。 
“好，让我来告诉你。你看到酒吧那头的两盏灯吗？当它们好像变成四盏时，就说明你已经喝够了，该回家了。” 
“但是，爸爸，”汤姆说，“我看到酒吧那头只有一盏灯啊。”


63 A School Outing

    The date for school outing was set for June 20th. The principal told us it would cost six dollars each. "This year,"he said, "We will go by train. This is a change from last year.?
    We assembled at the school at 9 o'lock, and by 9:30 we were aboard the train. It was a good arrangement. Each car held two classes. Three cars were added to the regular train so that there would be enough room for other passengers. As our classes were only about thirty each, there was plenty of room. We arrived at our destination by twelve, and each class went with its teacher to lunch. Then the guides came and took us for a tour of West Point and finally we stopped at a small river where we had snacks. We were on the train again by six o'lock. We never needed the raincoats everyone was carrying.

一次学校旅行
学校旅行的日子定在六月二十日。校长告诉我们，每个人要花六美元。“今年，”他说，“我们将乘火车去。这与去年不同。” 
我们九点在学校集合，九点半我们上了火车。这是个很好的安排。每个车厢可以容纳两个班。在常规列车上，加挂了三节车厢，这样其他的乘客也有足够的空间。因为我们每个班大约有三十人，所以有足够的地方。 
我们十二点到达目的地，每个班和他们的老师一起去吃午饭。然后导游来带我们去游览西点军校，最后在小河边停下来，我们在那儿吃点心。 
到六点钟，我们又登上了火车。我们根本没用上我们每个人都带的雨衣。


64 Halloween Party

We're having a Halloween party at school. 
I'm dressed up like Dracula. Man, I look cool! 
I made my hair black and I cut off my bangs. 
I'm wearing a cape and some fake plastic fangs.
I put on some makeup to paint my face white, 
Like creatures that only come out in the night. 
My fingernails, too, are all pointed and red. 
There's no doubt I look like the evil undead.
My mom drops me off and I run into school, 
And suddenly feel like the world's biggest fool. 
The other kids stare like I'm some kind of freak. 
The Halloween party is not'sil next week.

万圣节晚会
我们将在学校举办一个万圣节晚会。我装扮成吸血鬼的样子。看，我多酷！ 
我把我的头发染成黑色，剪去刘海，我穿上斗篷和戴上假的塑料尖牙。 
我用化妆品把脸涂白， 象那些仅在夜里出世的生灵。 
我的手指甲也是尖的，红色的。毫无疑问我看上去就像个不死的恶魔。 
母亲让我下了车，我冲进了学校，突然我感觉自己像是世界上最大的傻子。 
其他的孩子像看怪物一样地瞪着我，万圣节晚会要到下星期才开始呢。


65 My Uncle’s Farm 

    My Uncle Tom has a small farm. He has a lot of chickens. Every summer, during the holidays, I go to his farm and help him. I feed the chickens and collect and clean the eggs. Uncle Tom pays me something for my help.
    Twice a week we put the eggs in boxes and take them to town. There my uncle sells them. He gets quite a lot of money for them.My uncle's hens are rather stupid and noisy, I think. They are very useful because they lay the eggs, but I don's like them very much. I prefer the baby chickens and the cocks.My uncle has some white ducks too. They live on a pond on his farm. There are rows of trees all around the pond. Every evening my uncle puts food under the trees, and the ducks come up out of the pond to eat it.

我叔叔的农场
我的汤姆叔叔有个小农场。他有很多小鸡。每个夏天暑假的时候，我去他农场帮忙。我喂那些小鸡，拾捡鸡蛋，然后把它们擦干净。对于我的帮助，汤姆叔叔付给我一点钱。 
每星期两次，我们把鸡蛋放进盒子里拿到镇上。我叔叔在那里把它们卖掉。这样他挣了很多钱。 
我觉得我叔叔的母鸡真是又蠢又吵。虽然它们下蛋，很有用，但是我一点也不喜欢它们。我更喜欢鸡宝宝和公鸡。 
我叔叔也有一些白色的鸭子。他们住在农场的池塘里。池塘四周是一排排的树。每天傍晚，叔叔把食物放在树下，鸭子就从池塘里出来吃食。


66 The Football Match

    My brother Fred and I went to a football match yesterday. Our school team was playing against the Star High School team. Our team wore red and white shirts, white shorts and red stockings. The other team wore orange and black shirts, 
black shorts and orange stockings.
    They played like bees. They ran very fast, attacked very hard and passed the ball very fast. So they scored their first goal. Fred and I shouted and shouted, "Come on, Valley School! Come on, the Valleys!"Our headmaster was near us and he was shouting too. But the Star High School scored another goal. We were very sad.After a while our team began to play better and the bees were getting tired. Our team scored two goals before halftime. In the second half of the match, both teams tried very hard, but neither scored, so at the end of the match was a tie.

足球比赛
昨天我和我兄弟弗瑞德去看足球比赛。我们的校队和明星高中队进行比赛。我们队身穿红白上衣，白色短裤和红色长袜。另外一队身穿橙黑上衣，黑色短裤和橙色长袜。 
明星队的队员们像蜜蜂一样。他们跑得很快，攻势凌厉，传球迅速。所以他们踢进了第一个球。我和弗瑞德一直喊着：“山谷队，加油！山谷队，加油！”我们校长就在我们旁边，他也在喊叫。但明星高中又进了一个球。我们很伤心。 
过了一会儿，我们队开始踢得越来越好了，而那些“蜜蜂”们也累了。在半场结束前，我们队进了两个球。 
在下半场比赛中，两队都踢得很努力，但是都没有得分，最后比赛成了平局。


67 Danielle’s Story of Team Sports

    Being involved in a team sport is not only fun, it's a great way to meet new friends and learn new things. When I was younger, I played basketball and soccer, skating, performed gymnastics, played piano, and danced. One of my best friends is a girl who I met while playing basketball. Most of my fondest memories come from being involved in those activities. Though I was never really the best at any of those activities, I always had fun. The first year I played basketball I was on a team of all boys. The ball was rarely passed to me, but I learned a bunch of new techniques and I learned to love basketball much more.

    Sometimes, if you're on a team sport you may feel self-conscious, but remember that everyone probably feels the same way as you. Hopefully you all will learn to appreciate the value of team sports as much as I did. Go team!

involve 牵涉，涉及   perform gymnastics 练/表演体操    rarely 很少
technique 技巧   self-conscious 害羞的，怕难为情的 
appreciate 欣赏   value 价值


丹妮尔团队运动故事

参加团队运动不仅有趣而且是结交新朋友学习新事物的好途径。当我年轻的时候，我打篮球和橄榄球，滑冰，练体操，弹钢琴，跳舞。我最好的一个朋友是我在打篮球时遇到的一个女孩。我大多数的美好记忆都来自于参加这样的活动。虽然我从来没有真正擅长过其中的某一项，但我从中得到乐趣。我第一年打篮球时，队伍中都是男生。球很少传给我，但是我还是学会了一些新技术，我也越来越喜欢打篮球了。 
参加团队运动，有时你会感到害羞，但是记住每个人可能都会有你这样的感觉。希望你能和我一样学着体会团队运动的价值。去参加团队运动吧！


68 Celebration of Chinese New Year

    Celebrations of the Chinese New Year in Chinese families last for about two weeks. The celebrations begin with traditional house cleaning. The Chinese get rid of old and useless things. They do this to throw away the misfortunes of the past year. 
    On Chinese New Year's Eve all family members enjoy a big, delicious meal. It is very important for the Chinese to be with their families on this occasion. Fish is always part of the dinner because it represents abundance. On New Year's Day all Chinese children wear new clothes with bright colours. Red is considered a lucky colour. Parents and relatives give children the traditional New Year's gift called lucky money" This money is put into bright red and gold envelopes.

庆祝春节
中国家庭的春节庆祝活动持续大约两个星期。庆祝从传统的家庭大扫除开始。中国人扔掉旧的没用的东西。这么做是为了扔掉去年的晦气。 
在中国的除夕之夜，所有家庭成员一起享用美味的大餐。这个时候和家人呆在一起，对中国人来说是非常重要的。鱼总是晚餐必不可少的，因为鱼象征着年年有余。 
大年初一，孩子们都穿上颜色鲜艳的新衣服。红色被认为是幸运的颜色。父母和亲戚都给孩子们传统的新年礼物，叫做“压岁钱”。这些钱被装在印有金字的红色信封里。


69 The Ant and the Grasshopper

    One day a grasshopper came upon an ant at work in a garden. "Good day,"said the grasshopper. "It is a beautiful day, is it not?""Yes,"said the ant. "But the days will not stay as beautiful as they are now.""Just so!"said the grasshopper. "One must eat and be happy when one can. How is it, then, that you work when you could be playing?"
    "Cold days are coming,"said the ant. "If I work now, I can eat and be happy when bad times are upon us."The grasshopper laughed at the little ant and went on his way. By and by the days turned cold. First the rains fell, and then the snow. The grasshopper could not find anything to eat. "Oh, me!"cried he, as he thought of the little ant. "I was wrong to laugh at her."A little work when times are good is a big help when times are bad.

蚂蚁和蚱蜢 
一天， 蚱蜢碰到了一只正在花园里干活的蚂蚁。 “你好，”蚱蜢说，“今天天气真不错，不是吗？” “是的，”蚂蚁说，“但天气不会总是像现在这么好的。” 
“确实如此！”蚱蜢回答，“我们应该在能吃的时候吃，能开心的时候开心。那么，你在本来可以玩的时候却干活，是怎么回事呢？”
“寒冷的日子快来了。”蚂蚁说，“如果我现在干活，那么当糟糕的日子来临时，我就可以吃，可以开心了。” 
蚱蜢嘲笑着那只小蚂蚁，还是我行我素。渐渐的，天变冷了。开始下雨了，然后下雪。蚱蜢找不到任何吃的东西。 
“哦，天啊！”当他想起那只小蚂蚁时，他叫到，“我以前还嘲笑她，是我错了。”境遇好的时候做一点工作，在境遇不好时，会是很大的帮助。


70 Hobbies

    My hobby is collecting stamps. When I began, I tried to collect the stamps of all the countries, but now I collect only Greek and Indian ones because I have friends in Greece and I live in India. Some of my stamps are very pretty, and they are all interesting. When you look at stamps carefully, they teach you a lot about the history of other countries.
    My brother's hobby is watching trains. He goes to our station and watches them there. When an engine goes through the station he writes down its name and number. He likes train watching very much, but I don's. I went to the station with him one day, but it wasn's interesting. 
    My sister's hobby is sewing. She hasn's got a sewing machine, but she sews with our mother's. Sometimes she sews by hand too. She makes most of her clothes, and when I tear my shirt or my trousers, I take them to her and she mends them.

业余爱好
我的爱好是集邮。开始时，我设法收集所有国家的邮票，但是现在我只收集希腊和印度的，因为我有朋友在希腊，而我生活在印度。我的一些邮票非常漂亮，而且都很有趣。当你仔细看邮票时，它们会教你很多其他国家的历史。 
我兄弟的爱好是看火车。他去我们的车站，在那里看火车。当一辆车进站时，他写下车名和车号。他非常喜欢看火车，但我不喜欢。一天，我和他一起去车站，但那一点都不有趣。 
我姐姐的爱好是缝纫。她没有缝纫机，但她用妈妈的。有时她也用手缝。她大多数的衣服是她自己做的，当我扯破衬衣或裤子时，我就把它们拿给她补。


71 Computer Chess

    In May 1997, IBM's supercomputer, called Deep Blue, beat Gary Kasparov, the great chess player from Russia, in New York. This was the first time a supercomputer had ever beaten a man in traditional chess, although men had often lost to computers when playing speed chess. In traditional chess, players have as much time as they want for their moves, but in speed chess their time is limited. 
    The IBM computer is able to know between two and three million chess positions every second. It can make 100 billion moves in the time it takes a man to make one. 
    The first time Kasparov played Deep Blue was in Philadelphia in 1996. Kasparov won that first match. In May 1997 there was a match again, and Deep Blue won. Deep Blue got $700,000 for the game, and Kasparov took home $400,000. Now Kasparov wants to play a third match to decide who is the best player, but IBM says that Deep Blue has "retired?

计算机弈棋
1997年5月，IBM的超级计算机“深蓝”在纽约击败了俄罗斯伟大的国际象棋大师卡斯帕罗夫。虽然下快棋时人们经常输给计算机，但这是超级计算机在传统棋类上第一次击败人类。在下传统棋时，棋手有足够的时间考虑再出棋，而下快棋时思考时间是有限的。IBM的计算机每秒可以计算200万到300万手棋，可以在人走一步棋所需的时间里走1000亿步棋。 
1996年，卡斯帕罗夫在费城第一次与“深蓝”交手，卡斯帕罗夫赢得了比赛。1997年5月，他们又进行了一次比赛，这次“深蓝”赢了。从这场比赛中“深蓝”赢得了70万美元的奖金，而卡斯帕罗夫也将40万美元收至囊中。现在卡斯帕罗夫想进行第三次比赛来看谁才是最好的棋手，而IBM说“深蓝”已经退休了。


72 The Fox and the Goat 

    One day a fox fell into a well, and try as he would, he could not get out. As he was trying to think what to do next, a goat 
came by, looking for some water. "Friend Fox!"called the goat. "How do you find the water down there?"
    "It is as good as any water could be,"said the fox. "You would do well to come down and see for yourself.""That I will,"said the goat, and he jumped down into the well. As the goat put his head down to try the water, the fox jumped up on his back. One more jump, and he was out of the well. "Just a minute!"called the goat, when he saw what was happening. 
    "How am I going to get out of here"?"You should have thought of that before you jumped down,"said the fox. "Dext time look before you leap!"And he went on his merry way.

一天，一只狐狸掉进了井里，无论他怎么想办法，他都出不来。正当他努力想着接下来该怎么办时，一只山羊走过来找水喝。 
“狐狸老兄！”山羊叫他，“你觉得下面的水怎么样啊？” 
“这里的水比任何其他地方的水都好喝。”狐狸说，“你最好下来自己尝尝。” 
“我会的，”山羊说着跳进了井里。 
当山羊低下头尝水时，狐狸跳到他背上。再一跳，他跳出了水井。 
“等一下！”当山羊看到发生的事情后，他喊起来。 
“我怎么出去啊？” 
“你跳下来之前就应该想好的。”狐狸说，“下次你跳之前要看清楚。”然后他愉快地上路了。


73 Ellen’s Day

    One day Mrs. Smith and her daughter, Ellen, went visiting a family. There were six children. Ellen felt that she was going 
to have a very good day. 
    The twins, Paul and Pauline, were Ellen's age, seven years old. Bob and Ann were older. There was the little daughter, 
Ruth, who was six, and the baby, who was just crawling around on the floor. 
    Ellen ran and jumped and rolled a hoop with the children. Paul took some fishing rods, and they all went down to the brook to fish. Bob and Paul taught Ellen how to fish. It was fun, but Ellen didn's catch any fish. Her clothes were wet, but it wasn's Ellen's fault because children all get splashed when they fish. The five children went back to the house, but they paused to rest several times. It was soon time to go home, so Mrs. Smith put a shawl around Ellen. She had had such a wonderful time with so many children!

一天，史密斯太太和她女儿，艾伦，去拜访一户人家。那里有六个孩子。艾伦知道她会度过很快乐的一天。 
保罗和波林是双胞胎，和艾伦一样大，七岁。鲍勃和安年长一点。接下来还有个小女儿鲁思，六岁，还有一个小婴儿，还在地上到处爬。 
艾伦和那些孩子们一起跑、一起跳、一起滚铁环。保罗拿来一些钓鱼竿，他们都去小溪边钓鱼。鲍勃和保罗教艾伦怎么钓鱼。那很有趣，但是艾伦一条鱼都没捉到。她的衣服湿了，但这并不是艾伦的过错，因为所有的孩子在钓鱼时都会被溅湿。 
五个孩子回家了，但是他们停下来休息了几次。 
很快就到回家的时候了，史密斯太太给艾伦围上了围巾。她和这么多孩子一起度过了多么快乐的时光啊！
 

74 The Wolf and the Lamb

    Once upon a time a Wolf was walking toward a spring on a hillside. When he looked up, he saw a lamb just beginning to 
drink a little lower down. "There's my supper,"thought he, "If only I can find some excuse to eat it."Then he called out to the lamb, "How dare you muddle the water from which I am drinking?"
    "Do, master, no,"said the lamb, "if the water is muddy up there, I cannot be the cause of it, for it runs down from you to me.""Well, then,"said the Wolf, "Why did you call me bad names this time last year?""That cannot be true."said the lamb, "I am only six months old."
    "I don's care,"shouted the wolf, "If it was not you it was your father,"and with that he rushed upon the poor little lamb and ate her all up. But before she died the lamb cried out, "Any excuse will serve a tyrant."

狼和羊 
从前，有一只狼正朝着山坡上的泉水走去。当他抬起头来看时，发现一只小羊羔正在稍低处喝水。“我的晚餐有了，”他想，“要是我能找到些借口去吃掉她就好了。”于是，他对羊大叫：“你竟敢弄脏我要喝的水。” 
“没有，大人，”小羊羔说，“如果你那儿的水脏了，那不是我的原因，因为水是从你那里流到我这里的。” 
“那好，”狼说，“那去年这时候你为什么辱骂我？” 
“那不可能，”小羊羔说，“我才六个月大。” 
“我不管，”狼大叫，“如果那不是你就是你的父亲，”于是他冲向可怜的小羊羔，把她吃了下去。羊在死去前，大喊：“欲加之罪，何患无辞。”


75 Cat Timmy 

    Timmy was a little cat. He had four brother and sister cats, so his mother was kept busy feeding and washing her new family. Timmy was the bravest cat, or maybe, he was the most unwise cat because he couldn's even see when he rolled so far away that his mother had to pull him back to her warm corner. Mother Cat had to pull Timmy back and warned him, "This is the safest place for you now. Stay here until you can run."But Timmy still liked to walk around, and when he could walk more steadily on his little feet, he would go to the far corner of his box and try to get out. Then there came a day when a heavy foot crossed the floor, and suddenly, without a warning word from Mother Cat, down came that huge foot on Timmy's tail and then he cried and rushed back to his warm, comfortable family! 

bravest （brave的最高级）最勇敢的    unwise 愚笨的    steadily 稳定地

小猫"提米" 
提米是只很小很小的猫。他有四个猫兄妹，所以猫妈妈不停地忙着给她的新子女喂食、清扫新家。提米是最勇敢的小猫，或者也许他是最笨的小猫，因为他还不知道他已经翻筋斗滚得太远了，他妈妈不得不把他拉回温暖的角落。猫妈妈不得不把提米拖回来并警告他：“现在对你来说这是最安全的地方。在你会跑之前，一直呆在这儿。” 
但是提米还是喜欢闲逛，当他能用他的小腿跑得更稳一些时，他会跑到他的纸箱最远的角落，并试着出去。 
然而有一天，有一只大脚重重地踩在地板上，突然间，在没有猫妈妈的任何警告下，那只大脚踩在了提米的尾巴梢儿上，紧接着，他嚎叫着逃回到他那温暖、舒适的家。


76 Snow

    Have you ever seen snow? A lot of people in the world have not. A lot of countries never have snow — or have it only on the tops of very high mountains. In Canada there is quite a lot of snow every winter, but in the southern US there is usually very little. When a student from a warm country like Vietnam comes to Canada in the autumn for the first time, he feels cold at first, and most students from warm countries do not like this. 
    Snow is different. Although it is very cold, it is also very beautiful. Perhaps, after several dark mornings, the student wakes up one day, and there is a lot of light in his room. He thinks, "Is it so late?"and jumps out of bed, but no, it is not very late. He looks out the window — and there is snow, on the ground and everywhere. The light in his room came from that smooth, clean, beautiful white snow. 


雪 
你看见过雪吗？世界上有很多人都没有见过。许多国家从来不下雪——或者只有在很高的山顶上有雪。在加拿大，每个冬天都下很多雪，但美国南部通常很少下雪。 
当一个来自像越南这样温暖的国家的学生在秋天第一次到加拿大时，他首先感觉到的就是寒冷，而大多数来自温暖国家的学生不喜欢这么冷的天气。 
雪就不同。虽然雪很冷，但是很漂亮。也许，在几个阴沉的早晨之后，有一天，学生醒来时房间里很亮。他会想，“天很晚了吗？”然后跳下床，可是不对，并不是很晚。他朝窗外看去—是雪，地上是雪，到处都是雪。原来他房间里的光亮来自光滑、干净、美丽的白雪。


77 In through the Window

    One day my father took us for a family drive in the country. We arrived home before seven. Dad pulled into the driveway and we got out. Dad walked to the door. His hand came out of his pocket. He tried his other pockets, but they too were empty. He realized that he didn's have his door keys. He tried the window. It was firmly shut. He went around to the back, and we followed, but mother was always afraid of burglars, and the rear windows were just as tightly closed. "John, run up to Mr. Wilson and ask if you can borrow his ladder,"he said. I went too, and in a few moments we were back with it. "Mr. Wilson says he wants the ladder back right away."We took it around to the back, and David went up the ladder while Dad held it. The frontdoor was soon open, and we left Mary and Susan to prepare dinner while we returned the ladder.

一天，我爸爸带我们一家到乡下兜风。我们七点到家。爸爸把车开进车道，我们下了车。爸爸朝大门走去。他的手从口袋里拿出来。他又试了一下其他口袋，但它们都是空的。他意识到他没有带大门钥匙。他试了试窗户。窗户都紧紧地关着。他绕到屋后，我们都跟着他，但妈妈总是害怕有窃贼，所以后窗同样也关得紧紧的。“约翰，快去找威尔逊先生，问他是否能借他的梯子。”他说。我也去了，几分钟后，我们带着梯子回来了。“威尔逊先生说他希望梯子马上就还回去。” 
我们把梯子拿到后面，大卫爬上梯子，爸爸帮他扶着。前门很快就开了，我们留下玛丽和苏珊准备晚饭，而我们去还梯子。

78 A Clever Servant

    Once upon a time, there lived a rich man. He had a servant. He and the servant loved wine and good food very much. Each time the rich man left his home; the servant would drink the wine and eat up all the nice food in the house. The rich man knew what his servant did, but he had never caught his servant doing it. 
    One morning, when he left home, he said to the servant, "Here are two bottles of poison and some nice food in the house. You must take care of them."With these words, he went out. When the rich man was away from his home, the servant enjoyed a nice meal. When the rich man came back, he couldn's find his food and wine. He became very angry. So he asked the servant, "Where are my wine and food?"The servant said a cat had eaten up the food. He was afraid to be punished so he drank the poison to kill himself.

聪明的仆人 
从前，有一个有钱人，他有一个仆人，他和他的仆人都喜欢好酒和美食。每当富人离开家后，仆人就喝酒，吃光家里所有好吃的东西。富人知道仆人的所作所为，但他从来没有当场抓住过。 
一天早上，当富人离开家时，他对仆人说：“家里有两瓶毒药和一些好吃的食物。你必须好好照看它们。”说完，他就走了。 
当富人离开家后，仆人尽情享受了一顿美味大餐。富人回来后，找不到食物和酒，他很生气。他问仆人：“我的酒和食物到哪里去了？”仆人说有一只猫吃光了所有食物，他怕受到惩罚就喝下了毒药以结束自己的性命。


79 Our Playground

    There is a big park in our town with lots of trees, flowers, and grass in it. There are also places for tennis and volley-ball. There is a pond for small boats and a very small zoo, with a few wild animals in it.
    For children the best place in the park is the playground. There they can swing and slide and go round and round for hours. During school hours, only the very small children are there, but on summer evenings, on Saturdays, and Sundays all the year, there are older children too. I like going to the playground with my friends because we are happy there. We laugh and shout and joke with each other. There is a shed near the playground, and when it rains hard, the children go in here and wait until the rain stops. Then they come out again, running and shouting and laughing and in a minute they are all sliding and swinging and going round and round again.

我们的游乐场 
我们镇上有个大公园，里面有很多树、花和草。那里还有打网球和排球的地方。里面有个池塘可以划小船，还有个很小的动物园，里面有一些野生动物。 
对孩子们来说，公园里最好的地方是游乐场。他们可以荡秋千、滑滑梯、到处跑，玩上好几个小时。在上课时间，那里只有很小的孩子，但在夏天的晚上、全年的周六和周日，那里也有大一点的孩子。我喜欢和朋友们一起去游乐场，因为在那里我们很开心。我们笑啊、叫啊，互相开着玩笑。 
游乐场旁边有座小屋，下大雨时，孩子们就在这里等雨停。然后他们又出来，跑着、叫着、笑着，很快，他们又都在荡秋千、滑滑梯、到处跑了。


80 A Free Show

    Jack lived in a village. As his father was very poor, Jack had little pocket money. One day a circus came to the village. Jack was very fond of going to the circus. He wanted to go very much, but he had no money. After lunch Jack went out and wandered slowly round the circus tent. Inside the tent the band was playing music and people were shouting happily. Jack was excited, so he tried putting his head first through a small opening in the tent. Just then, a guard found Jack out. "Hey, this is not an entrance,"he shouted and pulled him out. 
    Then Jack went to the back of the tent. There was another opening. Another guard was standing there. This time Jack turned backwards and tried to enter with his legs first. When the guard saw him, he shouted, "Hey, this is not an exit. You can's leave from here."He pushed Jack into the tent. So Jack got to see the Circus after all.

随后杰克又走到帐篷的后面。这里也有一个口子。另一个保安站在那里。这次杰克背过身去，试着先把脚伸了进去。保安看到了他，保安大叫，“嗨，这不是出口。你不能从这里出去。”他把杰克推进帐篷里。这样，杰克终于看到了马戏表演。


81 Climbing Mountains

    Do you like climbing mountains? My friend Ted does. He has never climbed a dangerous mountain, but he has climbed some quite big and difficult ones. He began to climb rocks when he was a small boy. Ted liked it very much and he did not get very tired. The next year his father took him up some mountains in Scotland, and he was very happy. 
    Last summer holidays, Ted's uncle invited him to go to Switzerland. The mountains are high there. They went to Switzerland by train and had a very good holiday. They climbed several mountains. At the end of the holiday he said to Ted, "You are still very young, but you already climb well."Ted was very glad. 
    Now Ted wants to go to China to climb some of the very high peaks in the Himalayas, but he is still too young and also he hasn's got enough money. Perhaps one day he will become rich, and then he will go to China.

你喜欢爬山吗？我朋友特德喜欢。他从没爬过危险的山，但他曾爬过一些很大很难爬的山。当他还是个小男孩的时候，他就开始攀登岩石了。特德很喜欢这个运动，一点也不感到疲倦。第二年，他父亲带他登上苏格兰的一些山，他非常开心。 
去年暑假，特德的叔叔邀请他去瑞士。那里的山很高。他们乘火车去了瑞士，过了一个非常愉快的假期。他们爬了几座山。在假期结束时，叔叔对特德说：“你还很年轻，但你已经爬得很好了。”特德听了很高兴。 
现在，特德想去中国，爬上喜玛拉雅山最高的山峰，但他年纪还太小，而且没有足够的钱。也许有一天他会变得富有，然后他就可以去中国了。

    Jane's class is going to visit the zoo tomorrow. Our town has a big zoo with lots of animals in it. There are some beautiful tigers and two old lions. Lions and tigers are fierce animals, so when they are in zoos, they live in strong cages. They eat a lot of meat every day. 
    There are also two big elephants and a baby one. Jane wants to ride on one of the elephants. The elephants are tame and kind. They eat a lot of grass everyday. They like children because they sometimes give them bread and bananas. Elephants like bananas very much. In our zoo there are also brown bears, black bears and white bears. They stand on their back legs, hold up their arms and ask for food. They like cakes very much. 
    There is also a Children's Corner in our zoo. There children ride horses and donkeys and watch monkeys. The monkeys are very funny. They climb up ropes and jump down again and play with each other like small children. They love nuts and bananas and bread.

84 Things My Mother Taught Me

    How interesting is your life? The answer is how clever you are when you turn the dull routines of life into laughter. I learned the meanings of these words from my mother when I was a teenager.

我妈妈教我的事情 
你的生活有多少乐趣？答案在于，你是否能够聪明地把枯燥的生活琐事变成笑声。在十几岁时，我从妈妈那里知道了下面这些话的含义。 
妈妈教会我迎接挑战……“你在想什么？我和你说话时要回答我……别顶嘴！” 妈妈教会我逻辑学……“如果你从秋千上掉下来摔断了脖子，你就不能和我一起去商店了。” 
妈妈教我凡事要想在前面……“如果你通不过考试，你就上不了大学。” 妈妈教我如何成为一个大人……“如果你不吃蔬菜，你就长不大。” 
妈妈教我遗传学……“你跟你爸爸一模一样。” 妈妈教我关于年龄的智慧……“当你到我这个年纪时，你会明白的。” 
以及我一贯的最爱……公平……“有一天，你会有孩子，我希望他们像你一样……那样你就会明白怎么回事了。”


85 A Survivor of a Plane Crash

    On Christmas Eve 1971 Juliana left Lima by air with her mother. They were on their way to Pucallpa, another town in Peru. Forty-five minutes later the plane broke up in a storm, and Juliana fell 3,000 meters, strapped in her seat. She was not killed when the seat hit the ground but she lay all night unconscious.
    The next morning Juliana woke up, and found herself among the broken pieces of the plane, and called for her mother, but nobody answered. Juliana's collar bone was broken, one knee was badly hurt and she had deep cuts on her arms and legs. She decided to try to get out of the jungle, because she knew that if she stayed there she would die. 
    After ten days she came to a river and saw a hut. People discovered her and took her to a doctor in the next village. Juliana knew afterwards that there were at least three other people who were not killed in the crash, but she was the only one who got rescued.

86 A Party

    We are going to have a party in our house this evening. It is my mother's birthday, and she has invited my uncles and aunts and some of her friends. Mother and I are ordering most of the food for the party, and Father is getting the drinks. The living-room looks very pretty. Balloons of all colours are hanging from the lights. 
    In the dinning room we have put out the best plates, glasses and table cloths, and it all looks beautiful. We are going to have soup, fish, chicken, fruit and cheese. We are going to dance until midnight and after that, we will have some more food, because we will be hungry after all that dancing. 
    Last year my mother had her birthday party in a restaurant, but it is pleasanter at home. When it is my birthday, I am going to invite my friends and have a party in the garden. I will hang pretty lights in the trees and we will grill our food in the garden and dance on the grass. 

宴 会 
今晚我们将在家里举行宴会。今天是我妈妈的生日，她已经邀请了我的叔叔、阿姨们，还有她的一些朋友。我和妈妈正在订宴会的大部分食物，而爸爸正准备喝的。客厅看起来很漂亮。五颜六色的气球从灯上吊下来。 
我们在餐厅里摆出了最好的盘子和玻璃杯，还有桌布，它们都很漂亮。我们还会有汤、鱼、鸡、水果和奶酪。我们将跳舞跳到半夜，之后，我们会再吃点东西，因为跳了那么久的舞之后，我们会肚子饿。 
去年我妈妈在一个餐厅举行了生日宴会，但在家里会更开心。我生日时，我打算邀请我的朋友在花园里开宴会。我要在树上挂漂亮的灯，在花园里烧烤食物，在草地上跳舞。


87 Fishing

    Henry likes fishing. He fishes in the river near our house. In the evenings he makes lies"out of little pieces of wool and cotton and ties them to his hooks. Then on Saturday afternoon he goes down to the river and fishes until it is dark. There are always a few other people there. They love fishing too, and they all sit there quietly for hours. Sometimes they catch some fish. Sometimes they do not.
    Once Henry caught a big fish and he was very happy! All the other fishermen left their places and came to see his fish. One of them had a camera, so he took a picture of Henry with his big fish. Another time Henry fell into the river. The grass was slippery because there was some mud on it, and while he was pulling his line in, he slipped and fell into the dirty water. Henry does not swim, but the two nearest fishermen pulled him out quickly, and he ran home, with mud all over his face.

钓 鱼 
亨利喜欢钓鱼。他在我们家附近的小河里钓鱼。晚上，他用小团羊毛和棉花系在钓钩上做成“小虫子”。然后，星期六的下午，他就去河边钓鱼，一直钓到天黑。那里一直还有其他一些人。他们也喜欢钓鱼，他们都在那里安静地坐上好几个小时。有时他们会钓到一些鱼，但有时什么也钓不到。 
有一次，亨利钓到了一条大鱼，他非常高兴！所有其他钓鱼的人都跑过来看他的鱼。他们中有人有照相机，所以他给亨利和他的鱼照了张相。还有一次，亨利掉进了河里。因为草上有泥浆，很滑，当他收线时，他滑倒在脏水里。亨利不会游泳，但离他最近的两个钓鱼者很快把他拉了出来，他跑回家，满脸都是泥巴。


88 Princess Misbehaviour

    Once upon a time there lived a beautiful princess named Brianna. Everyone in the country thought she was pretty, but no one would play with her because she never listened to anyone, including the King and Queen. One night, while she was sleeping, a little birdie came to her in her dreams and told her that if she failed to listen to her parents her beauty would fade away. She laughed at the bird and called him foolish. She said she would stay beautiful until her dying day. 
    But next morning she awoke to find her long pretty hair was gone; all her pearly white teeth were missing. She broke down and cried out to the little birdie that had been in her dreams, begging him to make her beautiful again. She vowed she would never disobey her parents again. The little bird was moved by the princess and restored her beauty. She was so happy that she was back to her beautiful self. From that day forth she had lots of friends and no one ever laughed at her again.

无礼公主 
从前，有一位美丽的公主，名叫布兰娜。国人们都认为她很漂亮，但是没人愿意和她玩，因为她从来不听任何人的话，包括国王和王后的话。一天晚上，她正在睡觉时，一只小鸟进入了她的梦乡，小鸟告诉她，如果她不听父母的话，她的美貌就会慢慢消失。她嘲笑那只鸟，还叫它傻瓜。她说她会一直拥有她的美貌，直到她死去。 
但第二天早上，她醒来时，发现她美丽的长发不见了，珍珠般雪白的牙齿也没了。她崩溃了，对着曾经出现在她梦里的小鸟哭起来，求它让她重新变得美丽。她发誓再也不会违抗她的父母了。小鸟被公主感动了，恢复了她的美貌。重新又变回了原来的美丽，公主开心极了。从那天以后，她有了很多朋友，而且没有人嘲笑她了。


89 Turtle’s Life Cycle

    There are many different kinds of turtles throughout the world. They vary widely in size and in looks. However, in many ways they are all alike. They all have a covering of scales. They are like snakes and lizards, and they can live both on land and in water.
    As winter comes, turtles go to sleep in the mud under the water through the cold weather. 
    All turtles hatch from eggs. In early summer, the turtle digs out a hollow in the soft ground. Here she lays her eggs, and covers them with earth and leaves them to hatch in the warm sun. 
    As soon as the baby turtles hatch, they head for the water, out of sight of their enemies the gulls, foxes, and other animals. 
    The young turtles eat insects and small animals, and grow fast. Although the turtles spend much of their time in the water, they breathe in the air. When the full grown turtle is ready to lay eggs, she returns to the land and the turtle's life cycle begins again.

龟的生命周期
全世界有很多种不同的龟。它们在大小和外形上有很大的不同。然而，在很多方面它们是相似的。它们都有龟甲。它们像蛇和蜥蜴，能在陆地和水里生活。
冬天来临的时候，龟在寒冷的天气里呆在水底下的泥里睡觉。
所有龟都是从蛋里孵出来的。初夏，龟在松软的泥地上挖一个洞。它在这里产下蛋，用土盖住蛋，然后把它们留在这儿，让温暖的阳光把龟蛋孵化成幼龟。
龟宝宝一孵出来，就爬向水里，远离它的敌人的视线，它的敌人有海鸥、狐狸及其他一些动物。
幼龟吃昆虫和小动物，它们长得很快。虽然龟大多数时间呆在水里，但是它们在空气中呼吸。 
当长大的龟到了生蛋年龄时，它回到陆地上，这样龟的生命周期又重新开始。


90 Jim’s Stomachache

    Jim went to the doctor this morning. He likes apples very much and yesterday he ate too many green ones, so this morning he had a stomachache. When he came to breakfast he was crying. "What's the matter, Jim?"His mother said. "Why are you crying?""My stomach hurts, mother,"he answered. "You ate too many apples yesterday,"she said, "and they were green. Go to Dr. Jones and he will give you some medicine.""Yes Mother. I don's want any breakfast now."Jim got to Dr. Jones"office at 9:30, but there were four other people in the doctor's waitingroom, so Jim didn's see the doctor until about 10 o'lock. "What's the matter with you, young man?"said Dr. Jones. "I have a stomach-ache,"said Jim. "Have you eaten any green apples?"asked the doctor. "Yes, I ate a lot yesterday,"Jim said, and smiled. The doctor smiled too. He wrote on a piece of paper and said, "take this to a chemist, and he will give you some medicine."Jim thanked the doctor, went to a chemist and bought the medicine. His stomachache was soon better. 

吉姆肚子疼 

吉姆今天早上去看医生了。吉姆很喜欢吃苹果，昨天他吃了太多的青苹果，所以今天早上开始肚子疼。吃早饭时，他哭了。“怎么啦，吉姆？”她妈妈问，“你为什么哭啊？”“我肚子疼，妈妈，”他回答。“昨天你吃了太多的苹果。”妈妈说，“它们都是青的，还不熟。去看琼斯医生吧，他会给你开一些药。”“好的，妈妈。我现在不想吃早饭。” 
九点三十分，吉姆到了琼斯医生的诊所，但候诊室里还有四个人，所以吉姆大约十点才见到医生。“小伙子，怎么啦？”琼斯医生问。“我肚子疼？”吉姆说。“你有没有吃青苹果啊？”医生问。“是的，昨天我吃了很多。”吉姆说着笑了。医生也笑了起来。他在一张纸上写着，说：“把这个交给药剂师，他会给你一些药。”吉姆谢过医生，去药剂师那里买了药。很快，他的肚子疼就好了。


91 Cows

    My friend Jim has a farm. He has a lot of cows and he sells their milk. He does not milk the cows by hand: he has an electric milking machine. He gets up very early every morning, milks the cows with his machine, lets them out into the fields, gets the milk ready, puts it in very big cans, washes the milking machine and the buckets, puts the milkcans out in the road, and then has his breakfast. At about 8 o'lock a big truck comes and collects his milk cans. After breakfast, Jim goes to his desk and writes letters and bills and other things. When I visited him last year, he said to me, "Do you know, Bill, a farmer has a lot of paperwork now. He is like a clerk in an office."Jim loves his farm, but he hates paperwork. 
    After he has finished, he cleans his cowsheds and then goes out into his fields to look at his cows, or does some work in his vegetable garden. He is always very busy and his wife is too.

母 牛
我朋友吉姆有个农场。他有很多奶牛，他出售牛奶。他不用手工挤奶，他有电动挤奶机。他每天早上很早起来，用机器挤牛奶，然后把母牛放到外面的牧场上，把牛奶处理好后，把它装进一个很大的奶罐里，然后洗干净挤奶机和奶桶，再把奶罐放到路边，然后他吃早饭。大概八点钟的时候，有辆大卡车过来收他的牛奶。 
吃完早饭后，吉姆走到书桌边写信，写账单，并处理些其他的事情。去年我去看他时，他对我说：“你知道吗，比尔，现在一个农夫也有很多文书工作要做，就像是办公室里的职员。”吉姆喜欢他的农场，但他不喜欢文书工作。 
做完这些以后，他清扫牛舍，然后去牧场看他的母牛，或者在菜园里干点活。他总是很忙，他妻子也是。


92 Will Daddy Be Home? 

    Becky was six years old. On Christmas Eve she helped her mother hanging a stocking marked "Daddy? Becky asked her mom, "Will Daddy be home before Santa comes?"Becky's mom said, "I certainly hope so."Then Becky wanted her mother to put some cookies out for Santa. Mom said it was a great idea. Then Becky went to bed to sleep. 
    Becky woke up early next morning. She went to wake up her parents and said, "Can we see if Santa came, Daddy? Can we, Mommy?"By now Becky's parents were not only awake but also as excited as she was. 
    As they got down the stairs Becky and her parents were pleased to see that there were lots of presents under the tree for them. Becky noticed that the sugar cookies for Santa were gone and there was a note next to a present that said, "Give these to your Daddy. He was home and in bed by the time I got here."Becky grabbed her Daddy by the leg and said, "Thank you daddy. I knew you'd make it home in time."

爸爸会来得及回家吗？ 
贝基六岁了。圣诞节前夕，她帮她妈妈一起挂起了标着“爸爸”两个字的长筒袜。贝基问她妈妈：“圣诞老人来之前，爸爸能赶回家吗？”妈妈说：“我希望他能。”接着，贝基想让妈妈给圣诞老人准备一些饼干。妈妈说那是个很棒的主意。然后，贝基就上床睡觉去了。 
第二天一大早，贝基就醒了。她跑去叫醒爸爸妈妈，对他们说：“我们能去看看圣诞老人是不是来过了吗，爸爸？可以吗，妈妈？”这时，贝基的父母不仅醒了，而且还和贝基一样兴奋。 
来到楼下，贝基和爸爸妈妈看到圣诞树下有那么多给他们的礼物，他们高兴极了。贝基注意到，那些送给圣诞老人的甜饼干都不见了，一件礼物旁边有一张纸条，上面写着，“把这些送给你的爸爸。在我到达这里时，他已经到家上床睡觉了。”贝基抱着爸爸的腿说：“谢谢你，爸爸。我知道你会及时赶回来的。”


93 In a Boat

    My family likes the sea very much. When we have a holiday, we go to a place at the seaside and borrow a boat from one of our friends. Then we row, sail and fish on the sea all day. Sometimes we have races against other boats. When the sea is rough, we row and sail on a small lake near the sea instead. We are very careful on this lake because there are a lot of sharp rocks and the water is shallow. We do not want to damage our friend's boat. 
    There are not many fish in the lake, but in the sea we sometimes catch a lot with a hook, line and small pieces of bread. The fish are not very big, but they taste very good. When the weather is fine, we row to the land at lunch time, collect pieces of dry wood and fry or grill our fish over them on the beach. 
    There is an island a kilometre from our friend's house, and we often sail to it. The water is very clean and we often bathe there.

在船上
我们一家都很喜欢大海。度假时，我们去海边的一个地方，向我们的朋友借一艘船。然后我们整天都在海上划船、航行还有钓鱼。有时我们和其他的船比赛。
海上有风浪时，我们就在大海附近的小湖里划船。在这个湖上我们很小心，因为那里有很多锋利的暗礁，而且湖水很浅。我们不想损坏朋友的船。 
湖里的鱼不多，但是在海里，我们有时能用吊钩、绳子和小面包片抓到很多鱼。那些鱼不是很大，但是尝起来味道很不错。天气好的时候，中午我们划到岸边，在海滩上搜集几块干木头，在岸上煎鱼或者烤鱼吃。 
离我朋友家一公里的地方有座小岛，我们常常划船去那里。那里的水很干净，我们常在那儿洗澡。

A nice woman sat beside that. Mr. Brown asked, "Are you a grandmother?"The woman answered, "Yes, I have two granddaughters and two grandsons."Mr. Brown went to the third empty place. There was a man beside that, and Mr. Brown asked, "Are you a grandfather?""Do, I'm not,"the man answered. Mr. Brown smiled happily and said, "That's good. He sat down in the empty place and said to the man kindly, "Dow I'll tell you about my granddaughters and grandsons.

95 The Cinema

    Mary likes the cinema very much. She has no lessons and no homework on Saturdays, so she always goes to the cinema that afternoon. She prefers funny films but often she sees other kinds of films. She usually goes with some other schoolfriends, and they all sit together and eat nuts and ice cream and laugh when something funny happens. 
    Last Saturday Mary saw a film about a funny man. His name was Percy. Percy was fat and had a big, black moustache. He went out one night to play cards with his friends when his wife was asleep. When he was going home at midnight, a fierce dog ran after him and tore his trouser pocket, so Percy lost his key. He tried to climb up a ladder to get into his house through a window. But he slipped down the ladder and made a terrible noise. His wife woke up and cried, "Help! Thieves!"Someone telephoned the police and policemen quickly arrived. Percy ran away, but he slipped and fell into the mud at the side of the river. Mary and her friends laughed a lot.

电 影 
玛丽很喜欢看电影。星期六，她不上学也没有作业，所以星期六下午她总是去看电影。她喜欢喜剧，但她也常看其他电影。她通常和同学们一起去，他们坐在一起，吃果仁，吃冰激凌，看到有趣的地方，大家哄堂大笑。 
上周六，玛丽看了一部关于一个有趣的男人的电影，他的名字叫珀西。珀西很胖，长着又黑又密的胡子。一天晚上，当他妻子睡觉时，他出去和他的朋友玩牌。半夜他回家时，一条凶猛的狗追着他，撕破了他的裤子口袋，所以珀西的钥匙掉了。他试着爬上梯子想从窗户钻进去。可是他从梯子上滑了下去，发出很响的声音。他妻子醒了，叫起来：“救命！有小偷！”有人报了警，警察很快就到了。珀西逃离了现场，但却滑倒在河边的泥浆里。玛丽和她朋友都要笑死了。


96 Little Bear Cuffy 
    Once there were three bears who lived together in a little house in the forest. The biggest bear, named Tubby, worked hard all day finding berries and good things to eat for himself and his friends. The middle-sized bear, called Fuzzy, worked hard too, getting the honey from the trees. The third bear, who was called Cuffy, just rolled and played in the sun all day. 
    One day, Tubby and Fuzzy went deep into the forest to find food. They said, "Please come with us, Cuffy, we will be gone for a long time."But Cuffy said, "Do, thank you. If I go with you, I will have to work hard. I will stay here and play until you get back."So off went the two bears, and Cuffy played with the rabbits. But soon he began to get hungry, and asked the rabbits if he could have lunch with them. But the rabbit said he had to go to Farmer Brown's garden for carrots. Cuffy knew he could not do that. Poor Cuffy! How hungry he was for some nice sweet berries. "Dext time,"he said, "Just wait until next time! I will be glad to go and find food with Fuzzy and Tubby.

一天，塔比和法兹要去森林深处寻找食物。他们说：“卡夫，和我们一起去吧，我们
会去很久。”但是卡夫说：“不了，谢谢你们。如果我和你们一起去的话，我必须得辛苦作。我要呆在这儿玩，直到你们回来。” 两只小熊出发了，卡夫和兔子们一起玩。但很快他的肚子开始饿了，他就问兔子们他是否 以和他们一起吃午饭。但是兔子说他必须去农夫布朗的花园里找胡萝卜。卡夫知道他不会这么做的。 
可怜的卡夫！他是多么饿啊，好想吃几颗又甜又美味的浆果。“下一次，”他说，“就等到下一次！我一定乐意和法兹、塔比一起去找食物。”


97. The Hat Maker and Monkeys
    Once upon a time there was a man who made hats. He was a hat maker. He had enough hats to sell. One day he put the hats into his barrow and went along the road to the market. It was a long way and the hat maker was tired and hot. He came to a tree and sat down. Soon he fell asleep. There were monkeys up in the tree. The hat maker did not know this. The monkeys looked down. They saw the hats. Then they came down and took them. Each monkey put a hat on and each monkey went up the tree again.
    Then the man woke up. His barrow was empty. There were no hats in it. "Where are my hats?" he said. He looked left. He looked right. He looked round about. Then he looked up. He saw the monkeys with his hats on. "Oh dear!" he said. "Those naughty monkeys have stolen my hats." He shook his fist at them. The monkeys shook their fists too. The hat maker had an idea. He took off his hat and threw it on the ground. The monkeys took their hats too and threw them on the ground. The hat maker put his hats back in his barrow and quickly left for the market.

98 Spanish Farmers

    Rota is a very small town in Spain. It is famous for its fruits and vegetables. In particular, it is famous for its tomatoes and pumpkins. One would think that the soil of this region must be very good. It must be very rich in order to grow such excellent tomatoes and pumpkins. But the soil is not good. It is poor. It is only sand and rock — nothing more. The winds of the ocean blow hard. They have carried away the good soil. They have left only sand in its place. There is also little water. The soil is dry and hard. 
    The farmers of this region have to work very hard. They work from morning till night. They dig wells wherever there is water. They carry water by hand to their gardens. They use anything and everything to make the soil a little richer around each plant. They cover the young plants with leaves. In this way they protect them from the sun and wind. They watch each plant carefully. They watch the plants which are not strong. They give these plants more water and more attention. They show the plants the same affection they show for their wives or children. 
    There is a proverb about Rota farmers: the farmer of Rota touches each tomato 
plant at least forty times a day.

西班牙农民 
罗塔是一个很小的西班牙城镇。它以果蔬闻名，尤以番茄和南瓜最为出名。 
人们会以为这个地方的土壤肯定很好。能产出如此优良的番茄和南瓜，这里的土地肯定极其肥沃。但是，这里的土壤并不好，土地很贫瘠，只有沙子和岩石——别无它物。海风强劲，吹走了良土，只剩下沙子留在原地。这里缺水，土地又干又硬。 
此地的农民不得不非常辛勤地劳动。他们从早干到晚。他们在有水的地方挖井，提水到园地，用尽一切方法使作物周围的土更肥沃。他们拿叶子遮盖幼苗。这种方法可以保护幼苗免于日晒和风吹。他们关注每一株作物，密切观察着长得不壮的秧苗，给它们更多的水分和照料。他们像照料自己的妻子和孩子那样照料他们的农作物。 
说起罗塔的农民，有句谚语是这样说的： 罗塔农民每天至少要触摸每一株番茄四十次。


99 King Lion and Mouse

    One day a lion was sleeping peacefully in the forest when a mouse ran across his paw. Then he ran up the nose of the lion, awakening the great beast from his sleep. 
    The lion caught the little creature and the mouse, shivering with fear, cried out for mercy. "Please have mercy on me, King Lion! Please don's kill me! Forgive me this time, and I will never forget it. A day may come when I may be able to do something for you to repay your kindness."The lion smiled at the mouse's fright and laughed at the thought that so small a creature could ever help him, but he let the mouse go. Not long after this, the lion was caught in a hunter's net. The angry lion let out a roar that could be heard far and wide throughout the forest. Even the mouse heard it. He knew it was the voice of the lion. He recalled that the lion had been merciful to him then. So he ran to the place where the lion lay caught in the net of ropes. He said to him, "King Lion, now it's time for me to repay you."The mouse set to work at once, biting with his sharp little teeth at the heavy ropes that held the lion. Soon the lion was free.

狮子王和老鼠 
一天，狮子正在森林里安静地睡觉，就在这时，一只老鼠从他爪子上跑过。接着老鼠又跑到狮子的鼻子上，把兽中之王从睡梦中惊醒。 
狮子一把抓住那只小动物，而老鼠害怕地颤抖着，哭着求饶。 
“请饶了我吧，狮子大王！不要杀我！原谅我这次吧，我永远都不会忘记的。也许有一天我能为你做些事情来报答你的仁慈。” 
狮子笑着看着惊恐万分的老鼠，嘲笑这么小的一只动物竟然能有帮助他的想法，但他还是把老鼠放走了。 
在这之后不久，狮子被猎人的网套住了。愤怒的狮子发出嚎叫声，整个森林都能听到，甚至连老鼠都听到了。他知道这是狮子的声音。他想起狮子曾经对他很仁慈。所以他跑到狮子被绳网套住的地方。他对狮子说：“狮子大王，现在是我报答你的时候了。” 
老鼠马上开始工作，用他又尖又小的牙齿咬断缚住狮子的大绳。很快狮子就自由了。


100 Peeping into a Bird’s Privacy

    In early summer the bird population increases and we look forward to the return of many of our beautiful bird friends. Even birds like to spend time alone and will run away from their nest sometimes. We know that we can scare them, but when they are nesting, we allow our curiosity to overcome our good judgment. 
    Binoculars or field glasses are a great help when we want to see what birds are doing. A mirror set at an angle on a stick and held over a nest, will show us what is going on without our touching, pulling on the branches or annoying the mother bird. We must be careful if we want the birds to stay with us. We must be aware of the danger of cats and try to control them. We must also try to provide food, water, and shelter. If you provide all these things, without annoying the birds, you should have a fine bird population to entertain you this summer. 

peeping 窥视，偷看   privacy 秘密，隐私    nest 筑巢   curiosity 好奇心 
binoculars 双筒望远镜    entertain 娱乐，招待

窥探鸟类的秘密 
初夏，鸟的数量增长，我们盼望着许多美丽的鸟类朋友的回归。 
即使是鸟也喜欢独处，而且时不时地会离开自己的巢。我们知道我们会惊吓鸟类。但当他们筑巢时，我们会让我们的好奇心战胜我们的理智。 
当我们想要看鸟正在干什么的时候，双筒望远镜或野外望远镜用处很大。在树枝上安装一个镜子，调好角度，装在鸟巢的上方，镜子会向我们展示鸟巢中的情况，从而避免了我们直接去触摸，拉树枝或惹恼鸟妈妈。 
如果想让鸟和我们呆在一起，我们必须小心仔细。我们必须意识到猫的危险，要设法控制住它们。我们还必须想办法提供食物，水和庇护处。 
如果你能提供所有的这些东西，而且不骚扰鸟儿们，那么这个夏天，你就能有好多鸟儿陪伴你了。


1 Learning English in a New Environment 

    I was a little shy about talking to people when I first arrived in America ， but I had a strong desire to broaden my 
horizons and meet new people ． Once I gathered the courage to start conversations with people ， I found how easy it was to 
make new friends ． 
    Every day ， I heard enough new English expressions to make my head spin ． I found that when I was honest and asked about the meanings of unfamiliar expressions ， Americans were very helpful and took pains to explain them to me ． Native speakers of English tend to speak very fast ， and at first I was just stunned and looked at them with a dazed expression on my face ． I solved that problem by asking people to speak more slowly ． 

broaden ? 开阔，拓宽     horizon ? 眼界，视野   courage? 勇气    
spin? 晕头转向   take pains to explain 煞费苦心地解释 
tend to speak 倾向于说   stunned ? 惊愕地    dazed 茫然地 

在新的环境中学习英语
第一次到美国，与人说话时我总有些害羞，但是我非常渴望能够开阔视野，结识新朋友。当我鼓起勇气开始与人交谈，我发现原来结交新朋友是多么容易的事啊。 
每天耳边出现的繁多的新英语表达法把我弄得晕头转向。我发现当我诚实地向美国人询问那些不熟悉的说法的意思时，他们非常乐于助人，并煞费苦心地向我解释。
以英语为母语的人说话一般很快，一开始我只能惊愕地一脸茫然地看着他们。我让他们说得慢一些，这样我就解决了这个问题。


2 Too Difficult To Spell 

    A policeman returned to his police station one evening and reported to the sergeant that he had found an old car with no license plates ．
     “ Where was it? ” asked the sergeant ． “ In Ecclesiastes Street ， beyond the bridge ，” answered the policeman ． The sergeant opened the report book and began to write ． He asked the policeman how to spell the name of the street ， but he was not sure whether the spelling was correct ． At last he decided the name was too difficult for him to spell ． So he ordered the policeman to write the report ． The policeman also tried to spell the name of the street ， but he couldn't ， either ． Then the policeman put his helmet on and began to walk out slowly ． 
     “ Where are you going? ” the sergeant asked ． “ Back to Ecclesiastes Street ，” answered the policeman ． “ I'm going to push the car round the corner into Green Street．” 

sergeant ? 警官 
license plate 汽车牌照 
helmet ? 头盔 

太难拼写 
一天傍晚，一个警察回到警察局，向警官报告说他发现了一辆没有牌照的旧汽车。 
“车在哪里？”警官问。“在 Ecclesiastes 大街，在桥的那边。”警察回答。 
警官打开报告本开始记录。他问警察如何拼写那条大街的名字，但是他吃不准他的拼写是否正确。最后他觉得这个名字太难，他拼不出来。所以，他命令警察来写报告。警察拼了半天，也拼不出来。警察戴上他的头盔，慢慢地往外走。 
“你到哪里去？”警官问。 
“回到 Ecclesiastes 大街去，”警察回答，“我要把那辆车推到 Green 大街的拐角上去。”



3 Where Does the Word “ Robot ” Come From ？

    The word robot comes from the Czech word robota ， meaning heavy labour ． A robot is a machine that works automatically ． Robots can do a wide variety of tasks ． They are especially suitable for doing jobs too boring ， difficult ， or dangerous for human beings ． Robots efficiently carry out such routine tasks as welding ， drilling and painting automobile body parts ． They also produce plastic food containers and wrap ice cream bars ． Some industrial robots can even make electronic equipment and watches ． The science and technology that deals with robots is called robotics ． 
    A typical robot performs a task by following a set of instructions that tells it exactly what must be done to complete the job ．These instructions are entered and stored in the robot's “ brain ” of a computer or part of a computer ． 


efficiently ? 有效率地     routine ? 日常的，例行的 
weld焊接    drill ? 钻孔    electronic ? 电子的 

“ Robot ”（机器人）是如何得此名字的？
机器人 (Robot) 来源于捷克语 Robota 一词，意思是“累人的活”。机器人就是一种能自动操作的机器。机器人可以做许多工作，尤其适用于从事那些人们看来单调、困难、危险的工作。
机器人能有效地做那些重复性的劳动，如焊接、钻孔和为汽车零部件喷漆。它们还能用于制造塑料食品包装容器或包扎雪糕等工作。有些工业机器人还能组装电子设备和手表。研究机器人的科技叫人工智能学。一台典型的机器人必须通过精确执行它被告知的完成一项工作的一系列指令才能完成任务，这些指令储存在其“头脑”即计算机内。



4 Reading

    I think that people should spend more time reading． Reading has a lot of advantages． One of them is that it helps you develop reading skills． You have to read if you want to become a good reader． In other words， the more you read， the better 
you get at reading．Second， it helps develop a good vocabulary． Reading exposes you to new words， and you see how those words are used．Third， reading helps you develop good writing skills． If you read a lot， it will help you become a good writer．Finally， you can learn a lot from reading． You learn about current events from reading newspapers． A novel that is set in another country will help you learn about that country and how people live there． There is no limit to what you can learn． All this makes reading a beneficial activity．


expose ? 使……暴露于    current event 时事    beneficial ? 有益的


阅读

我认为人们必须花更多的时间阅读。阅读有很多好处。其中一条就是它能够帮助你发展阅读技巧。如果你想成为一个好的读者你必须阅读。换句话说，你读的越多，你的阅读技巧也就越好。
第二，阅读可以帮助你扩大词汇量。阅读可以使你接触新的单词，你可以知道这些词语是如何使用的。
第三，阅读帮助你发展写作技能。如果你读的多，这会有助于你的写作。
最后，你可以从阅读中学到很多。你可以从阅读报纸中了解时事。一部以其他国家为背景的小说可以帮助你了解这个国家和那里的人民。你所能学到的东西是无限的。所有这些都使阅读成为了一项有益的活动。


5 Three Jokes

Joke 1
Co-workers sympathized with my mother when she complained that her back was really painful from moving furniture． “Why don't you wait till your husband gets home?” someone asked． “I could，” my mother told the group， “but the couch is easier to move if he's not on it．”

Joke 2
A fourth grader asked the teacher's assistant， “how old are you， Mrs． Glass?” “You should never ask an adult's age，” I broke in． “That's okay．” Harriett smiled． “I'm fifty．” “Wow， you don't look that old，” the boy said． I was about to breathe a sigh of relief when another child chimed in， “Parts of her do．”

Joke 3
My elderly neighbour and his wife were told there could be a 45-minute wait for a table at a popular restaurant as they had no reservations． “Young man， we're both 90 years old，” he told the waiter， “we may not have 45 minutes．” They were seated immediately．

6 The 21st Birthday

    All of his life George from Cape Breton had heard stories of an amazing family tradition． It seems that his father，    grandfather and great-grandfather had all been able to walk on water on their 21st birthday． On that day， they'd walk across the lake to the boat club for their first legal drink．
    So when George's 21st birthday came around， he and his pal Corky took a boat out to the middle of the lake． George 
stepped out of the boat and nearly drowned! Corky just managed to pull him to safety．
    Furious and confused， George went to see his grandmother． “Grandma， it's my 21st birthday， so why can't I walk across the lake like my father， his father， and his father before him?” Granny looked into George's eyes and said， “Because， you dumb ass， your father， grandfather and great grandfather were born in January. You were born in July．”

legal 　合法的    drown ? 淹死     furious 愤怒

21岁生日
生于Cape Breton的乔治自出生以来就听说了一个令人惊奇的家族轶事。他的父亲、祖父、曾祖父似乎都在他们二十一岁生日那天在水上行走。那一天，他们走过湖面，去划船俱乐部喝他们第一杯合法的酒。所以当乔治的二十一岁生日到来的时候，他和他的伙伴高尔基驾船来到河中央。乔治跨出船外，但他差一点淹死！高尔基拼命把他拉了上来。乔治感到生气和困惑，他去问他的祖母，“祖母，今天是我二十一岁的生日，但我为什么不能像父亲、祖父和曾祖父那样走过湖面呢？”祖母注视着他的眼睛说，“傻瓜，因为你的父亲，祖父和曾祖父在一月出生，而你生在七月。”



7 No Work in the Dark

    I urgently needed a few days off work， but I knew my boss would not allow me to take a leave． I thought that maybe if I acted crazy he would tell me to take a few days off． So I hung upside down on the ceiling and made funny noises． My co-worker asked me what I was doing． I told her I was pretending to be a light bulb so the boss would think I was crazy and give me a few days off． A few minutes later the boss came in and said， 
     “What are you doing?” I told him I was a light bulb．He said：“you are clearly stressed out． Go home and have a rest for a couple of days．” I jumped down and walked out of the office． When my co-worker followed me， the boss said to her， “And where do you think you're going?” She said， “I can't work in the dark!”

leave ? 假期     stress out 压力过大

我不能摸黑工作
我急切地需要请几天假，但我知道老板不会同意。我想要是我装疯他也许会让我请几天假，所以我把自己倒挂在天花板上，发出古怪的声音。我的同事问我在干什么。我告诉他，我正装成个电灯泡，这样老板会觉得我疯了而准我几天假。几分钟后，老板进来了，他说：“你在干什么？”我告诉他我是个电灯泡。
他说：“你肯定是压力太大了。回家休息几天吧。”我跳了下来，走出了办公室。当我同事跟着我出来时，老板问她：“你准备到哪里去？”她说，“我不能摸黑工作。” 


8 Volcanic Eruption

    In north-west Cameroon in August 1986， there was a volcanic eruption which devastated the area． At least 1，200 people were killed and many were left seriously ill with burns and respiratory infections． Nobody could escape because there was no warning， just a loud explosion followed by a terrible smell like that of rotten eggs， and within a short time the entire area around Lake Nios， which was the site of the eruption， was covered in smokes．
    When help came to the villages on the shores of the lake，men， women， children and animals were found dead： some were outside their huts， some still in bed；others were in the fields or on the village road． It was as if a neutron bomb had exploded destroying nothing but killing all life． The disaster was the worst incident of its kind and the second time such a disaster had stuck this West African nation．

volcanic ? 火山的    eruption ? 爆发    devastate 破坏，摧毁
respiratory ? 呼吸的   infection ? 感染   explosion ? 爆炸
rotten ? 恶臭的，腐烂的    neutron bomb 中子弹    disaster ? 灾难

火山爆发
1986年8月，在喀麦隆西北部发生了火山爆发，灾害摧毁了整个地区。至少1200人丧生，许多人严重烧伤，感染呼吸道疾病。因为没有警告，没有人能够逃脱。一声巨大的爆炸声后就是一股难闻的臭鸡蛋的味道，短时间内Nios湖周围的整个地区，也就是火山爆发的地方，淹没在烟雾中。
当救援人员赶到湖边的村庄时，男男女女，孩子和动物都已经死亡了： 一些在他们的小屋里，一些还躺在床上，另一些在田野里或是在村里的路上。这好像是一次中子炸弹爆炸，什么也没有毁坏但却杀死了所有生命。这场灾难是这个西非国家遭受的最严重的一次火山爆发，也是这个国家所遭受的第二次大灾难。



9 Healthy Diet

    In order to stay healthy it is important to have a balanced diet — in other words， food that contains something from each 
of the three main groups of food． These groups are protein， carbohydrate and fat．
    Proteins are very important for building our bodies； they help us build new cells as old ones die． Meat and dairy products are major sources of protein， but not the only ones — we can also get protein from fish， eggs and beans．
    Carbohydrate and fat are important to enable us to store energy — they provide fuel for the body． Carbohydrates are found in sugar and in cereals such as rice， maize and wheat． Fats are found in meats， vegetable oil， butter， and nuts．Our body also needs minerals such as iron，calcium，and vitamins．Fish，vegetables and milk contain most of the minerals we need．Vitamins are found in fresh vegetables and fruit．


protein ? 蛋白质    carbohydrate 碳水化合物   cell 细胞
maize 玉米    mineral ? 矿物质    calcium 钙   vitamin ? 维他命


健康饮食
为了保持健康，饮食平衡很重要，换句话说，就是食用包含以下三大类的食物。这三大类是蛋白质、碳水化合物和脂肪。
蛋白质对于构建我们的身体非常重要；当旧细胞死亡时，它帮助我们生成新的细胞。肉类和奶制品是蛋白质的主要但非唯一来源，我们还可以从鱼类、蛋类和豆类中获得蛋白质。
碳水化合物和脂肪也很重要，它们使我们能够存储能量，它们为身体加油。碳水化合物可以在糖及谷类诸如大米、玉米、小麦中找到。脂肪可以从肉类、植物油、黄油及坚果中获得。
我们的身体也需要诸如铁、钙、维他命等矿物质。鱼类、蔬菜和牛奶中包含我们所需的大部分矿物质。维他命可以在新鲜的蔬菜和水果中获得。


10 The Marathon

    Twenty-six miles， 385 yards is rather odd distance for a foot race．Most other running races are measured in lengths of even numbers． The marathon，however，has an ancient history， going back to the early Greek Olympics．
    The Greeks started the Olympics in 776 B．C． to honour the god Zeus． Every four years， they brought together athletes from all the Greek cities． A nationwide truce was called for the five days of competition held in Olympia．The first day was devoted to ceremonies， banquets，and sacrifices．Early events included running，boxing，wrestling，pentathlon，and various horse and chariot races．
    After 490 B．C．， a special long-distance race， the marathon， was added to commemorate the legendary feat of a Greek soldier． It was said that he ran from the Plain of Marathon to Athens， a distance of 22 miles， 1470 yards， to bring the news of the Greek victory over the Persian army． Upon exclaiming， “Rejoice! We have won!” he collapsed and died．

marathon 马拉松       athlete 运动员    nationwide ? 全国的
truce 休战   devote ? 奉献      ceremony ? 典礼   banquet ? 宴会     
sacrifice 祭祀   wrestling ? 摔跤   pentathlon ? 五项全能    
chariot race 战车比赛   commemorate 纪念    legendary feat 传奇性的壮举
exclaim 大喊   rejoice 欣喜，高兴    collapse ? 倒塌，崩溃，虚脱


马拉松
26英里285码对于跑步项目来说是个奇怪的距离。其他跑步项目大多是以偶数计算长度的。然而，马拉松有着悠久的历史，可以追溯到早期希腊奥林匹克运动会。
希腊人于公元前776年开始举办奥林匹克运动会以纪念宙斯。希腊各城市的运动员每四年聚集一次，在奥林匹亚举行竞赛，在这竞赛的五天内全国休战。第一天有典礼、宴会和祭祀。早期的项目包括跑步、拳击、摔跤、五项全能及各种马术和战车比赛。
公元前490年以后，奥林匹克运动会中又加设了一项特殊的长跑项目——马拉松，以纪念一位希腊士兵传奇性的壮举。据说他从马拉松平原跑到雅典，一共跑了22英里，1 
470码，为了带回希腊战胜波斯军队的胜利消息，在高喊出“欢呼吧！我们胜利了！”后，他倒在地上死了。

佛瑞德在洛杉矶的一个球队打球。他在一次车祸中伤了胳膊，于是就放弃打棒球了
　当时，大家都认为他会到他父亲的冰激凌工厂上班。但是佛瑞德宁愿吃冰激凌，也不愿意卖冰激凌。他曾经试着在市区的一家保险公司上班他早晨8点半就要到公司上班，这对佛瑞德来说太早了，所以干完第一个月后，他就辞去了这份工作。此外，他也不喜欢整天坐在办公室里。
　现在，佛瑞德的大部分时间都在公园里度过。他乐于教邻近的小孩怎么打棒球。需要一点钱的时候，他就在体育馆卖热狗。  


Lesson12 The Wright Brothers
    When they were young boys， Orville and Wilbur Wright received an inexpensive toy from their father． It was a flying toy made of cork and bamboo． The body was made of paper and the power was supplied by a rubber band． The toy was able to fly across the living room using its own power．
    The boys were fascinated． Older brother Wilbur began reading every book and newspaper article he could find about wings and flying machines． Orville later wrote， “We were lucky enough to grow up in an environment where there was always much encouragement to children to pursue intellectual interests； to investigate whatever aroused curiosity．” From what he read， he became convinced that it was possible to build an aircraft that would carry a man through the air．
    The two brothers worked hard on their dreams for several years． Finally they flew the first manageable aircraft into the air on December 17， 1903．They proved to the world the secrets of human flight．

cork ? 软木    pursue ? 追求，追寻   convince ? 确信，相信
manageable 可管理的   prove ? 证实，证明

怀特兄弟
当奥威尔和威尔伯&#8226;怀特还是小男孩的时候，他们从父亲那里得到了一个便宜的玩具。这是一个由软木和竹子做成的飞行玩具，它的身体是用纸做的，动力由一个橡皮筋提供。这个玩具可以靠其自身的动力在起居室里飞。
孩子们对它着了迷。哥哥威尔伯开始读他所能找到的所有关于机翼和飞行器的书籍和报道。奥威尔在后来写到，“我们很幸运成长在这样的环境中，人们总是鼓励孩子去追寻自己的研究兴趣，去钻研任何引起他们好奇心的东西。”从他所读过的书中，他确信人类是可以造出载人飞行器的。
兄弟俩为着他们的梦想努力工作了多年，终于在1903年12月17日驾驶着第一架可操控的飞行器飞上了天。他们向世界解开了人类飞行之迷。


Lesson13 The Dangers of Secondhand Smoke
    Most people know that cigarette smoking is harmful to their health．Scientific research shows that it causes many kinds of diseases．In fact，many people who smoke get lung cancer．
    However， Edward Gilson has lung cancer， and he has never smoked cigarettes． He lives with his wife， Evelyn， who has smoked about a pack of cigarettes a day throughout their marriage． The Gilsons have been married for 35 years． No one knows for sure why Mr． Gilson has lung cancer．
    Nevertheless， doctors believe that secondhand smoke may cause ung cancer in people who do not smoke because nonsmokers often breathe in the smoke from other people's cigarettes． This smoke is called secondhand smoke． Edward Gilson has been breathing this type of smoke for 35 years． Now he is dying of lung cancer．
    However， he is not alone． The U．S． Environmental Protection Agency reports that about 53，000 people die in the United States each year as a result of exposure to secondhand smoke． We call this passive smoking．

nevertheless ? 然而    Environmental Protection Agency 环境保护署
exposure ? 暴露     passive 被动的

二手烟的危害
大多数人都知道吸烟有害健康。科学研究表明，吸烟能够诱发多种疾病。事实上，许多吸烟的人得了肺癌。
然而爱德华&#8226;吉尔松从不抽烟却得了肺癌。他和他的妻子伊芙琳生活在一起，婚后他的妻子每天要抽一包烟。吉尔松夫妇已经结婚三十五年了。没有人确切地知道为什么吉尔松会得肺癌。
然而，医生相信二手烟可能会使不抽烟的人患上肺癌，因为不抽烟的人经常吸入别人吸烟时产生的烟。这种烟叫做二手烟。爱德华&#8226;吉尔松吸这种烟吸了三十五年。现在他即将死于肺癌。
然而，他的情况可不是唯一的。美国环境保护署报道，每年在美国大约有五万三千人因吸入二手烟死亡。我们把这种情况叫做被动吸烟。



Lesson14 Dolphins
    Many people have experienced the joy of standing on a moving ship and watching a group of dolphins swim alongside． Dolphins are not only playful animals but they are also highly intelligent． They are mammals that can be found in most of the world's oceans as well as in fresh water．
    Dolphins can swim at speeds of up to 56 KPH and they can dive to depths of 200 meters and stay underwater for 5-8 minutes without resurfacing for air． They are well-known for the unique clicking sound they use like sonar to locate food as well as obstacles． Every dolphin has its distinctive individual whistling sound used for communication．
    When dolphins sleep， they sleep in a semi-alert state by resting one side of their brain at a time． They will help sick or injured dolphins as much as they can， and they act as a team if there is danger．
    It is because of these and other human-like qualities that people have a special feeling for dolphins．

dolphin ? 海豚    mammal ? 哺乳动物    resurface ? 重新露面   unique ? 独特的  
sonar ? 声波定位仪   obstacle ? 障碍物   distinctive ? 与众不同的
whistle ? 吹口哨   semi-alert ? 半警惕的

海豚
许多人一定会有这样开心的经历——站在航行的船上，看着一群海豚从旁边游过。海豚不仅是一种有趣的动物而且极其聪明。海豚是哺乳动物，人们可以在世界上大多数的海洋和淡水中找到它。
海豚的游速可以达到每小时五十六公里，可以潜到两百米深的地方，在水下待五到八分钟而不浮出水面。海豚另一有名的特点是它们可以使用独特的像声波定位器一样的敲击声来确定食物和障碍物的位置。每一头海豚都有自己与众不同的声音，他们靠发出这种声音互相交流。
当海豚睡觉时，它们处于半惊醒状态，每次只休息大脑的一半。它们会尽力帮助生病或受伤的海豚；在遇到危险时，它们会相互协助。
正是因为这些及其他类似于人的特性，人们对海豚有着特殊的感情。


15 A Man of Word and Not Deeds

A man of words and not of deeds
Is like a garden full of weeds.
And when the weeds begin to grow,
It's like a garden full of sonw.
And when the snow begins to fall,
It's like a bird upon the wall.
And when the bird away does fly,
It's like an eagle in the sky.
And when the sky begins to roar,
It's like a lion at the door.
And when the door begins to crack,
It's like a stick across your back,
And when your back begins to smart,
It's like a penknife in your heart.
And when your heart begins to bleed,
You're dead, and dead, and dead indeed.


deed 行为   weed 杂草   eagle 鹰   crack 爆裂，破裂
smart 刺痛    penknife 铅笔刀    bleed 流血


一个只说不做的人，就像是长满杂草的花园。当杂草开始生长，
它就像是个被雪覆盖的花园。当雪花开始纷飞，它就像一只墙上的鸟。
当鸟飞走了，它就像天空中的鹰。当天空开始咆哮，它就像门口的狮子。
当门开始破裂，它就像横穿你脊背的木棍。当你的背开始刺痛，
它就像刺入你心中的铅笔刀。当你的心开始流血，你就真正地死亡，死亡，死亡。



Lesson16 Believe That You Will Succeed
    Carnegie was born in 1888 to a poor farming family in the central United States． The boy didn't see a train until he was 12 years old． In his teens， he had to get up at 3 am every day to milk the family cows．
    When Carnegie first entered college， he felt hopeless because of his clothes and ordinary looks． His mother encouraged him：“Why not try to be better in other things instead of just dress and good looks?”
    Carnegie tried to be more active in college． He joined the debate team． But one after another， he lost 12 meets． The young man was very disappointed in himself． He said later that he thought of killing himself after so many failures．
    But soon Carnegie was seen practicing public speaking on the riverside． His hard work paid off at last． In 1906， Carnegie won a famous speech contest and became widely known．
    The young man made his own words come true：“Believe that you will succeed， and you will．”

相信你会成功
1888年卡内基出生在美国中部一个贫穷的家庭里。他十二岁才第一次看到火车。在他十多岁时，每天早上三点起床给家里的奶牛挤奶。
卡内基初入大学时，他因为衣着和相貌平平而感到绝望。母亲鼓励他说，“为什么不在衣着和长相以外的方面努力变得更好呢？”
卡内基开始积极参加大学活动。他参加了辩论队。但是他一次又一次地输掉了，一共输了十二次比赛。年轻人对自己非常失望。他后来说在这么多次失败后他曾想自杀。
但是很快人们又看到卡内基在河边练习演讲了。
他的努力最终没有白费。1906年，卡内基在一场著名的演讲比赛中获胜而一举成名。
这个年轻人证明了他所说的话：“相信你会成功，你就会成功。”


Lesson17 Umbrellas
    The umbrella is a very ordinary object． It keeps the rain in bad weather and the sun off in good． Most umbrellas fold up，so it's easy to carry them．
    However， the umbrella did not begin its life as an ordinary object． It was a sign of royalty or importance． Some African tribes still use umbrellas in this way today． Someone carries an umbrella and walks behind the king or important person．
Umbrellas are very old． The Chinese had them in the eleventh century B．C． From there， umbrellas traveled to India， Persia， and Egypt．
    When the Spanish explorers went to Mexico， they saw the Aztec kings using umbrellas． English explorers saw Native American princes carrying umbrellas on the eastern coast of North America． It seems that people in different parts of the world invented umbrellas at different times．
    England was probably the first country in Europe where ordinary people used umbrellas．
    Everybody uses umbrellas today． The next time you carry one， remember that for centuries only great men and women used them．

keep off 　制止，使避开，不让接近    royalty ? 王权，皇室
the Aztec kings　 阿兹特克王    Native Americans prince 印第安王子

伞
伞是一件非常普通的物品。它可以在恶劣的天气里挡雨，在晴好的天气里遮阳。大部分的伞可折叠，所以携带方便。然而，伞在发明之初并非一件普通物品。它是王权或重要性的象征。一些非洲的部落至今仍以这种方式使用伞——一个人拿着伞走在国王或重要人物的后面。
伞有着悠久的历史。中国人在公元前11世纪就发明了它，随后又传到了印度、波斯和埃及。
当西班牙探险家来到墨西哥，他们看到阿兹特克王使用伞。英国探险家在北美东海岸看到印第安王子拿着伞。世界各地的人似乎在不同时期发明了伞。英国可能是欧洲最早的平民可以使用伞的国家。
如今每个人都使用伞。下次当你拿着伞的时候，别忘了好几个世纪中只有王公贵族才能使用它。


Lesson18 
    The International Space Station: A World ProjectScientists have built an exciting project 270 miles into space． Sixteen countries from all around the world worked together to plan and construct a permanent space station． The 16 nations included the United States，Canada，Japan，Russia，Brazil, Belgium，Denmark，France，Germany，Italy，the Netherlands，Norway，Spain，Sweden，Switzerland，and the United Kingdom． In fact， the International Space Station (ISS) is the largest international scientific project in human history．Construction on the ISS began in 1998 and was completed in 2002．
    Six people from different countries live on the Space Station． It has a permanent laboratory where the scientists conduct research that they cannot do on Earth． These studies will be possible because the space station is almost completely outside Earth's gravity． Some of this important research will help scientists understand more about human learning and memory． The scientists will also be able to study Earth systems such as the oceans，weather，climate，and plant growth．These systems affect the quality of life for all people today，as well as for our future generation．


construct ? 建造    permanent ? 永久的   construction ? 建造   gravity ? 重力


国际空间站——一项全球性工程
科学家们已经在太空270英里处建造了一项激动人心的工程。世界上16个国家共同努力，设计并建造了一个永久性空间站。这16个国家包括美国、加拿大、日本、俄罗斯、巴西、比利时、丹麦、法国、德国、意大利、荷兰、挪威、西班牙、瑞典、瑞士和英国。事实上，国际空间站是人类历史上最大的国际性科学项目。国际空间站的建造开始于1998年，完工于2002年。
来自于不同国家的六个人居住在空间站中。空间站有一个永久的实验室，在那里科学家可以做他们在地球上无法做的实验，因为空间站几乎完全不受地心引力影响。其中一些重要的研究将帮助科学家更好地了解人类的学习与记忆。科学家还将研究例如海洋、天气、气候和植物生长等地球系统。这些系统将影响我们所有人及我们后代的生活质量。

Lesson20 The Lost Ring
    One day a man went home to his wife and said， “I have bought something for you!” “Oh， thank you!” said his wife． “What have you bought?”“I have bought a gold ring． Here it is!” He held it out for his wife to see． Then he dropped it． “Oh dear!” he said． “I have dropped it．”
    He began to look for it on the floor but it was dark inside the house and he could not see anything． He went outside the house and began to look for the ring in the street． Just then a friend came along． “What's the matter?” he asked． “I have lost a ring，” said the man． “Where did you lose it?” “I lost it inside my house．” “You lost your ring inside your house but you are looking for it outside in the street! That seems very foolish!” “Ah，” said the man， “but it is dark inside my house． I shall never find it there． But here in the street there is more light and I can see more clearly．”

ring ? 戒指

丢失的戒指
一天，有个男人回家对他的妻子说：“我给你买了件东西！” “噢，谢谢你！”他的妻子说。“你买了什么？”我买了一个金戒指。给你！”他拿在手上给妻子看。突然戒指掉在了地上。 “噢，亲爱的！”他说，“我把戒指弄掉了。”
他开始在地板上寻找，但屋里黑暗，什么也看不见。他走出屋子，开始在街道上寻找。正在此时，他的一个朋友走了过来。 “怎么了？”他问。 “我丢了一个戒指，”男人回答。 “在哪里丢的？” “在我的屋里丢的。” “你在屋里丢了戒指，却到外面的街道上找！这太愚蠢了！” “啊，”男人说，“我的屋里太黑了，在那里永远找不到。而街道上亮多了，我能看得更清楚些。”



Lesson21 Body Language
    Americans feel that physical contact can be important in breaking down barriers between people． Such physical acts as hugging， shaking hands and kissing in public are seen as displays of affection． In China， on the other hand， this is not common because physical contact is not the custom． Interestingly enough， most Chinese who spend some time in America come to like hugging； they learn that Americans use body language to express feelings． It is a way of saying “I like you and I care about you．”
    Shaking hands is another traditional way of greeting someone in America． Shaking hands is a more formal way of greeting than hugging． Whereas hugging shows closeness， shaking hands means that there is a little more formality in the relationship． Western people usually shake hands when meeting someone for the first time， or when they see someone again after a certain amount of time has passed． In Japan， people traditionally bow as a form of greeting． Other countries have different customs， like patting someone on the back or kissing．

barrier 障碍    affection 情感    formal 正式的
formality ? 拘谨，礼节   bow ? 鞠躬    pat 拍打

肢体语言
美国人认为身体接触对于打破人与人之间的障碍很重要。这些诸如拥抱、握手及在公众场合亲吻等身体接触都被看作是友好的表现。然而，在中国，身体接触就不那么普遍了，因为没有这样的习俗。有趣的是，大多数在美国度过了一段时间的中国人开始喜欢拥抱，他们知道美国人通过肢体语言来表达感情。这是一种表达“我喜欢你，我在意你”的方法。
在美国，握手是另一种传统的问候方式。握手比拥抱更加正式。拥抱表示亲密，而握手意味着两人关系中更多了一些拘谨与礼节。当第一次见面或隔了一段时间未见后再次见面时，西方人通常都是握手。在日本，人们通常以鞠躬表示问候。其他国家也有不同的习俗，比如拍某人的背或亲吻。


Lesson22 Attitudes to Work
    Anne Jones has been working at the City Bank for two years． Her boss is Mr.． Bascomb． She thinks he is a difficult man， and doesn't like working for him． Anne hates typing because it's so boring． And she can't stand taking orders． She avoids talking to Mr.． Bascomb as much as possible． “I can't go on doing this work，” says Anne． “It's driving me crazy”． Anne is happiest when she is away from the job． She loves singing and playing the guitar． Music is the most important thing in her life．
    Barbara Martinoli also works at the City Bank． She has been working there a little longer than Anne． Barbara and Anne are good friends， but they have different attitudes to their jobs． Barbara really enjoys working at the bank． She respects Mr． Bascomb and doesn't mind taking orders from him． Now that she is married， Barbara doesn't really need a job． Her husband， Tino， makes enough money to support both of them． But Barbara prefers working to staying at home． “It's better than doing nothing，” says Barbara．

drive sb． crazy 使某人发疯     respect ? 尊敬，尊重

工作态度
安妮&#8226;琼斯已经在花旗银行工作了两年。她的上司是巴斯康卜先生。她觉得巴斯康卜先生不好相处，因此不喜欢在他手下工作。安妮讨厌打字，因为打字是那么无聊。她也不能忍受被人指挥。她尽量避免和巴斯康卜先生说话。“我不能继续干这份工作了，”她说，“它要让我发疯了。”工作之外的时间里，安妮最快乐。她喜欢唱歌和弹吉他。音乐是她生活中最重要的东西。
芭芭拉&#8226;马蒂努里也在花旗银行上班。她在这里的工作时间比安妮长一点。芭芭拉和安妮是好朋友，但她们对工作有不同的态度。芭芭拉确实喜欢在银行工作。她敬重巴斯康卜先生，也不介意听从他的命令。芭芭拉已经结婚了，她其实不需要工作。她的丈夫帝诺挣的钱足够两人花。但芭芭拉喜欢工作而不是呆在家。“这比什么都不做要好，”芭芭拉说。


Lesson23 The Indian Who Could Foretell the Weather
    Two men were traveling in a wild and lonely part of America．For days they had not even seen a house， only a few huts made of wood， or tents made of skins．Then one day they met an old Indian who earned his living by trapping animals for their fur．They found that he knew their language and they had a little conversation with him．One of them asked him if he could tell them what the weather would be like within the next few days．
     “Oh yes，” he said. “Rain is coming， and wind． Then there will be snow for two days， but after that there will be bright sunshine．”
     “Isn't that wonderful?” said one man to his friend． “These old Indians know more of the secrets of nature than we do with all our science． They have not been spoiled by civilization．” Then he turned to the old Indian．
“Tell me，” he said， “how you know all that．”
    The Indian replied， “I heard it on the radio．”

foretell 预言    trap ? 诱捕   spoil ? 宠坏   civilization ? 文明

能够预测天气的印第安人
两个人在美国荒凉偏僻的地方旅行。几天来他们连房子也没有看到过一座，只有几处棚子和皮帐篷。一天，他们碰到了一个上了年纪的印第安人，这个老人以捕猎动物获取皮毛为生。他们发现老人能听懂他们的语言，于是就和老人攀谈了起来。他们中的一人问老人能否告诉他们今后几天的天气如何。
“哦，好的，”老人说，“马上要下雨了，还会刮风。然后会下两天雪，但那以后又会阳光明媚了。”
“简直太奇妙了。”那个人对他的朋友说。“这些印第安人知道的大自然的秘密比我们用科学知识知道得还多。他们没有被文明宠坏。”然后，他又转向那位老印第安人。
“告诉我，”他说，“你是怎么知道这些的？”
印第安人回答，“我听电台里说的。”



Lesson24 Halloween
    Halloween is a strange holiday． It started several centuries ago in Europe． It began as “Hallow Evening” meaning “holy night”． At that time November 1st was called “All Saints' Day” and people honoured all the saints who did not have their own special day． People believed that October 31st was the time when all the evil spirits were supposed to be active． So people would play all sorts of pranks on each other．
    Now Halloween has evolved to a children's holiday． Small children go “Trick-or-Treating”． They wear costumes， knock on doors， and yell， “Trick or Treat”． People almost always choose to give them candy as a treat， instead of opting to receive a trick from the children．
    The trick might be something like， “I'll spill all the trash out of your trash can if you don't give me a treat．”
Halloween is great fun for children today． They dress up as ghosts，witches，or frightening Dracula．Adults sometimes “trick or treat” their friends too． Usually that means the “treat” will be a glass of wine or cosmetics．

saint ? 圣人    evil ? 罪恶的，邪恶的    suppose ? 假设   prank 恶作剧，开玩笑
evolve ? 发展   trick 恶作剧    treat ? 请客，款待   opt ? 选择   spill 倒出   
trash ? 垃圾   witch 巫婆   Dracula ? 吸血鬼    cosmetic ? 化妆品

万圣节
万圣节是一个奇异的节日，它起源于几个世纪前的欧洲。刚开始的时候，它叫做“神圣夜”，意思是“神圣的夜晚”。那时，十一月一日被称为“万圣日”，在那天人们纪念所有没有特定纪念日的圣人。人们相信十月三十一日所有邪恶的精灵都会出来活动，所以人们互相玩恶作剧。
现在万圣节已经演变成为一个儿童的节日。小孩子玩“不请客就捣乱”的游戏，他们穿着特殊的服装，敲门，然后大喊，“不请客就捣乱。”人们总是选择请他们吃糖果，而不是接受孩子们的恶作剧。
恶作剧有可能是这样玩的，“如果你不请客，我就把你的垃圾都从垃圾筒里倒出来。”
如今万圣节给孩子们带来很大的乐趣。他们装扮成鬼、巫婆或者可怕的吸血鬼。成年人有时也和他们的朋友玩“不请客就捣乱”的游戏。这时请客的东西经常是一杯酒或是化妆品。

Lesson25 Help Out
    Yesterday morning John was working at the bookshop when he heard a loud noise． He looked out the window and saw something frightening． A large bus had just crashed into a truck． The driver of the bus had tried to avoid hitting a boy riding his bicycle in the street． He had turned sharply and crashed into a truck parked on the side of the road．
    John saw at least ten people getting out of the bus and heard them calling for help． He ran across the street to help． Suddenly he felt someone grab his arm． It was an old lady who had been in the bus． She had lost her wallet and was terribly upset． John looked for the wallet and found it lying near the bus． He was about to return it to the lady when a policeman came up behind him． The policeman asked John if there was a telephone in the bookshop． John told him there was a telephone by the cash register．The policeman ran over to the bookshop and called an ambulance．


crash ? 碰撞    ride one's bicycle 骑自行车   grab ? 抓住   cash register 收银机品

做好事
昨天早晨约翰正在书店里工作，突然听到一声巨响。他从窗户望出去，看到可怕的一幕。一辆很大的巴士撞到了一辆卡车上。巴士司机因为要避让街上一个骑自行车的男孩而猛然转向，撞到停在马路另一边的卡车上。
约翰看到至少十几个人从巴士里出来，并听见他们呼喊着求救。他穿过街道去帮忙。突然他感觉有人抓住自己的胳膊。这是巴士上的一个老太太。她丢了钱包，很悲伤。约翰四处寻找，发现钱包躺在巴士旁边。他正准备把钱包归还给老太太时，一个警察从他后面走过来。警察问约翰书店里有没有电话。约翰告诉他收银机旁有电话。警察跑到书店里，打电话叫了救护车。 


Lesson26 The First Stamp
    Have you ever mailed letters to your friends? If so， you must have put stamps on the letters before you sent them． So how did people receive letters before stamps were invented， and who came up with the idea of using stamps?
    In the past， stamps and envelopes were not used． When people wanted to send a letter， they would close the paper with a seal． The person who got the letter had to pay for it and the cost was very high． Because of this， some senders would often place secret marks on the outside of the letter． The person who was sent the letter would read the secret message． Then， he would refuse to accept the letter so as to avoid the payment．
    In Britain， Sir Rowland Hill introduced the “Post Office Reforms” in 1837． He decided that letters could go to any place in the country for a penny． The cost was to be paid by the sender by placing a small piece of black paper on the letter． Thus was born the first stamp in the world and was known for its nickname “Penny Black”．

seal ／si:l／ n? 图章

第一张邮票
你曾给朋友寄过信吗？如果寄过，那你一定在寄信之前在信封上贴上了邮票。那在邮票发明过去人们不使用邮票和信封。当人们想寄信时，他们会在信纸上盖封口章。收到信的人得付钱而且费用非常昂贵。正因如此，有些寄信的人通常在信外面标上特殊的记号，收信人会读懂这个特殊的记号，然后他就拒绝收信，免付邮费。
1837年，罗兰&#8226;希尔先生在英国倡导了“邮政改革”。他提出只要付一便士，信就可以寄到英国任何地方。费用由寄信人通过在信上粘贴一张黑色小纸支付。这样世界上第一张邮票就诞生了，人们昵称它为“黑便士”。



Lesson27 Learning To Understand Art
    Last week I went to an exhibition of paintings at the Tate Gallery in London． I'm not really a great art lover but I'd read some good reviews of the exhibition so I was keen to see it．
    I must be honest and admit that many the paintings disappointed me．Although I spent a lot of time looking carefully at each one，I had some difficulty in understanding what the artist was getting at． As I was looking with great effort at one of the paintings and trying to figure out if it was the right way up or not， an old gentleman came behind and started to explain the whole painting to me． He kindly answered all of my questions and we talked for over an hour． Then he said he had an appointment and had to go， so we shook hands and said goodbye． I went round the gallery once more and now I found that all the paintings seemed really beautiful．
    As I was leaving the gallery I found out who the old man was —his self-portrait was on the posters advertising the exhibition!

review 评论     appointment ? 约会    gallery ? 美术馆
self — portrait ? 自画像    poster ? 海报

学会欣赏艺术作品
上星期我去伦敦塔特美术馆看了一场绘画展览。我并不是一个真正的艺术爱好者，但我读过一些关于这次展览的很好的评论，所以我渴望去参观。
我必须诚实地承认许多绘画作品使我失望。虽然我花了很多时间仔细地看每一幅作品，但我还是很难理解艺术家所要表达的意思。当我费力地看着其中的一幅画并试图弄清楚它是否放倒了时，一位年长的绅士从后面过来，向我解释整幅画。他友好地回答我所有的问题，我们谈论了一个多小时。后来他说他还有个约会必须走了，我们握手道别。我又绕着美术馆走了一遍，现在我发现所有的画似乎都很美。
当我准备离开美术馆的时候我才知道那个老人是谁。他的自画像出现在该次展览的宣传海报上。



Lesson28 Three Jokes
Joke 1
I sold an item through eBay but it got lost in the mail， so I stopped by my local post office and asked them to track it down． “It's not that simple，” the clerk replied． “You have to fill out a mail-loss form before we can initiate a search．” “Okay，” I said． “I'll take one．” He searched his counter， and then went to ask some other clerks， who did the same — only to return and confess， “You'll have to come back later． We can't find the forms．”
Joke 2
A couple of hours into a visit with my mother she noticed I hadn't lit up a cigarette once． “Are you trying to kick the habit?” “No，” I replied， “I've got a cold and I don't smoke when I'm not feeling well．” “You know，” she observed， “you'd probably live longer if you were sick more often．”
Joke 3
Kids have a greater need for speed than classroom computers can deliver． Impatient to turn in his term paper， one restless student kept clicking the “Print” command． The printer started to churn out copy after copy of the kid's ten-page report． The topic? “Save Our Trees．”

track 追踪   clerk 办事员   initiate ? 开始   confess ? 承认   light up 点燃    
restless ? 坐立不安   command ? 命令   churn out 费力地送出来（指复印机）

笑话三则
笑话一
我通过易趣网出售一件物品，但在邮寄时遗失了，所以我去了当地的邮政局，请求他们把物品找回来。“这可不那么简单，”办事员回答。“在我们开始查找之前，你必须填一份邮件遗失表。”“好的，”我说，“我可以填一份。”他在柜台上翻找表格，然后又去问其他办事员，他们也在柜台上翻找。最后，他只得回来承认，“你必须等一下再来。我们找不到表格了。”
笑话二
我去探望我的母亲，几小时后她注意到我还没有点过一次香烟。“你是不是想戒了这个坏习惯？”“不，”我回答，“我感冒了，在我感到不舒服的时候我不抽烟。”“你知道，”她说，“如果你多生几次病，你可能会活的更久些。”
笑话三
教室里的电脑总是不能满足孩子们对速度的需求。一个坐立不安的学生正不耐烦地要递交他的学期论文，他不停地点击“打印”的命令。打印机开始一页一页艰难地打印这孩子的十页论文。论题是什么呢？“救救我们的树”。


Lesson29 Popcorn
    All corn does not pop． A seed of corn must have 14% water in it to pop． Other kinds of corn have less water and do not pop． When you heat a seed of corn， the water inside makes the corn explode． This makes a “pop” noise． That is why we call it popcorn．
    The American Indians popped corn a long time ago． The Indians knew there were three kinds of corn． There was sweet corn for eating， corn for animals， and corn for popping． The Indians introduced corn to the first settlers， or Pilgrims， when they came to America in 1620． One year after they came， the Pilgrims had a Thanksgiving dinner． They invited the Indians． The Indians brought food with them． One Indian brought popcorn!
    Since that time Americans continued to pop corn at home． In 1945 there was a new machine that changed the history of popcorn． This electric machine popped corn outside the home． Soon movie theatres started to sell popcorn to make more money． Popcorn at the movies became more and more popular．Today，Americans still continue the custom of eating popcorn at the movies．

popcorn 爆米花   explode ? 爆裂，爆炸    settler 定居者   Pilgrim 清教徒

爆米花
不是所有的玉米都能爆开。只有当一粒玉米种子里含有14%的水分时才能爆开。少于14%水分的玉米不能爆开。当你加热一粒玉米种子时，种子里的水分使玉米爆开，这时会发出“砰砰”的声音，所以我们把它称为爆米花。
很久以前美洲印第安人就开始爆爆米花。他们知道一共有三种玉米，分别是可以食用的甜玉米、给动物吃的玉米和爆爆米花的玉米。当第一批定居者，也就是清教徒于1620年来到美洲后，印第安人把玉米介绍给了他们。一年后，新移民举行了第一次感恩节，他们邀请了印第安人，印第安人带来了食物，其中有一个印第安人带来了爆米花！
从那以后，美国人一直在家里爆爆米花。1945年，一种新的机器改变了爆米花的历史。这种电动机器可以在家庭以外的地方爆爆米花。很快电影院里开始出售爆米花赚钱。电影院里的爆米花越来越受欢迎。现在美国人仍旧保持着在电影院里吃爆米花的传统。


Lesson30 The Moon in the Well
    A well is a hole in the ground． There is water at the bottom． To get the water we turn a handle． This lets a bucket go down the well and into the water． Then we turn the handle to bring the bucket up．
    One night a foolish man looked down a well． The water at the bottom was like a mirror． The man saw the moon in the water．
     “The moon has fallen down the well，” he said． “I must get it out．”
    He ran home to get a hook． He untied the bucket from the rope and tied the hook to the rope． Then he turned the handle and let the hook go down into the well． He wanted the hook to catch the moon and pull it up! The hook reached the water and the man turned the handle to pull up the hook． But the hook caught underneath a big stone． The man pulled and pulled but the handle would not move．
    Suddenly the stone moved． The hook flew up the well． The man fell on to his back． He could see the sky． The moon was in the sky．
“Good!” he said． “I have put the moon back into the sky!”

untie ? 解开，松开   underneath ? 在下面

井中之月
井是地上的一个洞。井底有水。为了取到水，我们转动一个把手。这样就使一个桶下沉到井里的水中。然后我们转动把手将桶提上来。一天晚上，有个愚蠢的人俯视水井。井底的水像一面镜子。这个人看到了水中的月亮。
“月亮掉到井里了，”他说。“我一定要把它捞出来。”
他跑回家拿了一个钩子。他从绳子上解下捅，把钩子系到绳子上。然后转动把手，将钩子放到井中。他要让钩子钩住月亮把它拽上来。钩子沉到了水中，这个人旋转把手往上拽钩子。但是钩子钩住了水下的一块大石头。他拽呀，拽呀，可把手就是不动。突然石头移动了，钩子从井里蹦了出来。他仰天摔倒了，看到了天空。天上有月亮。
“好啊！”他说，“我终于把月亮弄回了天空！”


Lesson31 Being Brave
    It was five o'clock in the afternoon． Barney had just had his hair cut at the barber shop when Fred came running up to him． Fred was out of breath and looked worried． He had spent the whole day looking for Marty and he thought Barney could help him find the boy． Marty's mother had tried to make him go to the dentist's to have his teeth checked． But Marty was scared and didn't want to go． Now he had disappeared and Fred thought Marty had run away from home．
Barney told Fred that he was going to Nick's garage to have his car fixed． Lots of kids from the neighbourhood went there because they liked to play games in the old， useless cars． It was possible that one of them had seen Marty or knew where he was． Barney offered to give Fred a ride to the garage in his taxi．
    When the two men arrived at Nick's they found Marty playing with some other boys． Fred convinced Marty that he had to be brave and go to the dentist's like a man． Marty finally agreed， but only if Fred would go there with him to give him courage． Fred smiled and put his arm around Marty． They got in Barney's taxi and went to the dentist's together．

barber 理发师   out of breath 上气不接下气   scared ? 恐惧的

做勇敢的人
下午五点，巴尼刚在理发店剪好头发，佛瑞德向他跑过来。佛瑞德上气不接下气，看上去很忧虑。他一整天都在寻找马蒂，觉得巴尼或许能帮他找找。马蒂的妈妈试图让马蒂去看牙医检查他的牙齿。但马蒂很害怕，不想去。现在他不见了，佛瑞德认为他离家出走了。
巴尼告诉佛瑞德，他准备到尼克汽车修理厂修车。邻近的很多小孩会去修理厂，因为他们喜欢在破旧无用的汽车里玩游戏。他们当中可能有人见到过马蒂，或者知道他在哪儿。巴尼让佛瑞德搭他的出租车到修理厂。
两人到达尼克修理厂时，发现马蒂正和其他男孩玩耍。佛瑞德劝说马蒂要做个勇敢的人，像个男子汉一样去看牙医。马蒂最终同意了，但是要求佛瑞德和他一起去，给他鼓气。佛瑞德笑了，把马蒂抱在怀里。他们坐着巴尼的出租车一起去了牙医那里。


Lesson32 Life in the City and Country
    Sam and Mabel Brown wish they lived on a farm． If they had a farm， they could raise animals and produce their own food． It is hard work， but Mr． and Mrs． Brown would enjoy the peace and quiet of being in the country． And they could spend more time with their children． Linda could have her own horse， and Jimmy could go hunting and fishing with his father． On the other hand， if the Browns left the city， Jimmy and Linda would miss their friends． The Browns almost bought a farm several months ago， but it wasn't what they expected． Nowadays， it's hard to find a good piece of farmland at a reasonable price．
    Elmer and Sarah Coggins have lived on a farm all their lives， and it hasn't been easy． In 1998 their house burned down． This year they have lost most of their corn and wheat crops because of bad weather． Sarah Coggins thinks it would be better if they moved to the city． Elmer could get a job working in his brother's supermarket， and she could open a bakery． She makes wonderful cakes and pies． If Elmer and Sarah moved to the city， they would make new friends and go out more often． But they would probably miss their farm． After all， it's the only life they have ever known．

raise 饲养    bakery 面包店

城市生活和乡村生活
萨姆和梅布尔&#8226;布朗希望自己能在农场生活。如果有个农场，他们就能饲养动物，生产自己的食物。劳动虽然辛苦，但布朗夫妇将享受到乡村生活的和睦和安静，而且他们可以有更多的时间和孩子们呆在一起。琳达可以有她自己的马，吉米能和父亲打猎和钓鱼。但是另一方面，如果布朗一家离开城市，吉米和琳达会想念他们的朋友。几个月前，布郎一家差点儿买了一个农场，但它不是他们所期待的那样。现今，以便宜的价格买到一小块好的农场很难。
埃尔默和萨拉&#8226;考金斯一直都住在农场，而农场的生活并不容易。1998年，他们的房子被大火烧毁了。因为今年天气不好，他们损失了大部分的玉米和小麦收成。萨拉&#8226;考金斯觉得如果他们搬到城里会好点。埃尔默能到他兄弟的超市里工作，她自己则可以开家面包店。她制作的蛋糕和馅饼味道很棒。如果埃尔默和萨拉搬到城里，他们将会结交到新朋友，且能更经常外出。但他们可能会想念自己的农场。毕竟，那是他们唯一熟知的生活。

Lesson34 Abraham Lincoln
    Abraham Lincoln was the sixteenth president of the United States． He was born in Kentucky in 1809． His family was very poor． When Lincoln was a boy， he worked on his family's farm． He did not go to school． He taught himself to read and write． Later， Lincoln studied law and became a lawyer． After that， he became a politician．
    Everybody liked Abraham Lincoln because he was intelligent and hardworking． Lincoln was very ambitious． He wanted to be good at everything he did． He said that he wanted to win the “race of life．” He was also kind and honest． People called him “Honest Abe．” 
    Lincoln became president in 1860． In 1861， there was a war between the North and the South of the United States． The North wanted the United States to stay together as one country． Lincoln was the leader of the North． In the war， brother killed brother． The Civil War was four years long．
    The North won the Civil War． The war ended on April 9， 1865． Six days later， President Lincoln and his wife went to the theater． Inside the theater， a man went behind the president and shot him in the head． Lincoln died the next morning．

1860年，林肯成为了美国总统。1861年，美国的南方和北方之间开战。北方希望美国统一。林肯是北方的首领。在战争中，兄弟互相残杀。内战持续了四年。
北方赢得了内战。战争于1865年4月9日结束。六天后，林肯总统和妻子一起去看戏。在戏院里，一个人走在总统后面，朝他的头部射击。第二天林肯去世了。


Lesson35 Peanut Butter
    Americans love to eat peanut butter， but what is it? It is a thick，creamy paste． You buy it in a jar at the grocery store． Manufacturers roast peanuts and take off the skin． Then they grind them into a thick paste — that's peanut butter!
The peanut is not really a nut， but a pea． It is a strange pea because it grows underground． But peanut plants also have green vines with yellow flowers． These vines or stems grow above the ground and are quite long． Peanuts are very healthy for you． They have more protein than a steak and they have many vitamins， too．
    The peanut comes from South America， but peanut butter is a food that is truly “American．” Peanut butter started in 1890 in St． Louis． A doctor made some peanut butter． He gave it to patients who could not eat regular food． Later， peanut butter was popular as a healthy food．
    Peanut butter is very popular with children in the United States． Perhaps their favourite way to eat it is in a sandwich． Many children add jelly to their peanut butter sandwiches． This makes a favourite snack or lunchtime meal．

thick 厚的   creamy paste 奶油色糊状物   jar ? 罐子   grind ? 压碎，碾碎
vine 藤蔓   stem 茎   steak ? 牛排   jelly ? 果酱

花生酱
美国人喜欢吃花生酱，但花生酱是什么呢？它是一种厚厚的、奶油色的糊状物。你可以在杂货店一罐一罐地买。生产商把花生烘干、去皮，然后把花生磨碎成厚厚的糊状物。这就是花生酱！
花生其实不是坚果，而是一种豆类。它很奇特是因为它长在地底下，但是花生的植株上也有绿色的藤蔓和黄色的花。这些长长的藤蔓或茎长在地上。花生对健康很有好处。它比一块牛排含有的蛋白质还多，而且还含有多种维他命。
花生是从南美洲引进的，但是花生酱却是正宗的美国食品。1890年花生酱起源于圣路易斯。一个医生做了一些花生酱，把它给了一位不能正常饮食的病人。后来，花生酱成为了受欢迎的健康食品。
花生酱很受美国孩子的欢迎。他们最喜欢的吃法就是把花生酱夹在三明治里。许多孩子还在他们的花生酱三明治里加些果酱。这是人们最喜欢的小吃或午餐。


Lesson36 Protecting Our Beach
    The other day I was taking a walk along the beach and I became very angry． I felt bad about the plastic bottles and wrappers that were tossed all over the sand． Rusty， empty beer cans lay about and some broken glass bottles made me mad． I was worried to see unhealthy leftover snacks being eaten by sea gulls． I had gone to the beach to enjoy nature but instead I ended up picking up garbage there． I wondered if I was the only one that felt so bad walking on the beach that day． I hoped that people would know that throwing their garbage all over the beach creates an ugly place that is also dangerous to both humans and the wildlife.
    Next time when we go to the beach we should be careful with our garbage．Remember to dispose of those plastic wrappers and aluminium cans and beer bottles properly． That way we can enjoy the beauty of the beach without worrying about cutting ourselves with pieces of glass or harming the wildlife there with unhealthy leftovers． It will be a much nicer place for all of us to spend our free time．

wrapper 包装纸   toss ? 投，掷   rusty ? 锈的   leftover ? 剩余的
gull ? 海鸥   aluminium ? 铝   dispose ? 处理

保护我们的海滩
有一天，当我沿着海滩散步时，我感觉很糟糕。因为沙滩上到处都是丢弃的塑料瓶和包装纸。到处躺着的生锈的、空的啤酒罐、破碎的玻璃瓶子让我很难受。我担心地看到海鸥正在啃食被吃剩的不健康的小吃。我原打算到海滩来享受自然，但最终却在那儿捡拾垃圾。我很想知道我是不是那天唯一一个在海滩上散步感觉如此糟糕的人。我希望人们能看到那到处都是的垃圾会使我们的海滩丑陋无比，这样的海滩对人和野生动植物来说都是很危险的。
下次我们再去海滩的时候，我们要记住妥善收拾好自己的垃圾。记住将那些塑料包装纸、铝罐和啤酒瓶妥善处理掉。这样我们才能尽情享受美丽的海滩，而不用担心我们自己是否会被玻璃碎片划伤，也不用担心人类不健康的残存食物会危害海滩上的动物。海滩才会成为我们休闲时更好的去处。


Lesson37 Three Jokes
Joke 1
At my job as a dental receptionist， I answered the phone and noticed on the caller-ID screen that the incoming call was from an auto-repair shop． The man on the line begged to see the dentist because of a painful tooth． “Which side of your mouth hurts?” I asked the patient． He sighed and answered， “The passenger side．”
Joke 2
When I was twenty-eight， I was teaching English to freshmen in a high school where occasionally the faculty and staff were allowed to dress down． One of those days I wore a sweatshirt and slacks． A student came in and his eyes widened． “Wow!” he exclaimed． “You should wear clothes like that every day． You look twenty， maybe even thirty years younger!”
Joke 3
Heavily laden with groceries， an old lady asked a young clerk at the grocery store to accompany her to her car． Arriving there， she unlocked and opened the doors and， without thinking， sat down in the back seat to check off her list of errands． A moment later the perplexed clerk walked around the car to her． “Lady，” he said firmly． “I don't mind helping you load your groceries， but I really have to draw the line at driving you home．”

occasionally ? 偶尔的   dress down 穿便服   laden 负重
errand ? 使命，任务   perplexed ? 困惑的   draw the line (at) 反对

笑话三则
笑话一
我是一个牙科诊所的接待员，工作时我接到一个电话，我注意到来电号码显示电话是从一个汽车修理店打来的。电话那头一个男人恳求看医生，因为他有一颗牙实在太疼了。 “你哪边牙疼？”我问病人。他叹了口气说，“乘客座位那边。”
笑话二
我二十八岁时，在一所高中教新生英语，学校的教职员工偶尔可以穿着便装。一天，我穿着运动衫和休闲裤，一个学生进来了，他的眼睛一下瞪得老大。 “哇！”他大叫，“你应该每天都这样穿。你看起来年轻了二十，甚至三十岁！”
笑话三
有位老夫人买的东西太重了，她让杂货店里的一个年轻伙计帮她把东西搬上车。到了车边，老夫人打开车门就毫不犹豫地坐到后排座位上开始检查她的购货任务完成情况。过了一会，困惑的伙计绕过车子走到她面前。“太太，”他坚决地说，“我不介意帮您搬东西，但我的确不能开车送您回家。”


Lesson38 The Metric System
    People in many countries use kilograms， centimetres， square meters， litres， and Celsius． These are all ways to measure things． They are all part of the metric system．
    During the French Revolution (1789—1799) against the king， the revolutionary government started the metric system． Before that France had different systems for measuring things in different parts of the country． Cloth makers measured cloth with one system． Jewellers used another system． Carpenters used another． Other countries used other systems． The revolutionary government wanted one international scientific system of measurement． They asked a group of scientists and mathematicians to invent it．
    The mathematicians and scientists decided to use the numbers ten， hundred， and thousand for their system． Next they had to decide on a “natural” length． They chose one ten-millionth of the distance from the Equator to the North Pole． They called this one meter． Then they chose one gram for weighing water in a cubic centimetre．
    Mathematicians and scientists worked on these problems for twenty years until they finally finished the complete system．The metric system was a wonderful gift to the world． There are only a few countries that don't use it． The United States is one． The metric system is truly an international system．

carpenter 木匠   jeweller ? 宝石商   mathematician ? 数学家
Equator 赤道   cubic centimetre 立方厘米

公制
许多国家的人使用公斤、厘米、平方米、升和摄氏。这些都是测量的方法。他们是公制的一部分。
在反对君主的法国大革命（1789—1799）期间，革命政府开始使用公制。在此之前，在法国不同的地方使用不同的度量衡制。裁缝用一种度量衡量布，珠宝商使用另一种度量衡，木匠又用另一种，其他国家又用不同的度量衡。革命政府希望有一种国际性的科学的度量衡。他们让一群科学家和数学家发明一种这样的体制。
数学家和科学家决定在他们的度量衡制中使用数字十、百、千。
接下来他们必须决定一种“自然的”长度。他们选择了从赤道到北极距离的一千万分之一。他们将它称作一米。然后他们将一立方厘米的水的重量定为一克。
数学家和科学家共同研究了二十年最终完成了这个度量衡制。
公制是献给世界的一份很好的礼物。只有很少的几个国家不使用它。美国是其中之一。公制的确是一个国际性的度量衡制。



Lesson39 Writing the Name Backwards
    The other day a man named William Smith went to a police station． He wanted to get a license to drive a car．Behind the desk in the police station sat a police captain． He was not a very polite man．“I would like to get a license to drive a car，” said Mr． Smith in a low voice． “You have to fill out this card first，” said the police captain． He threw a small white card in Mr． Smith's direction． “Put your name at the top．” “In ink?” asked Mr． Smith very politely． “Of course， in ink!” said the police captain． “Put your last name first and your first name last．” “How's that?” said Smith． He did not understand the police captain． “Write your name backwards． Your last name first and your first name last． BACKWARDS!” “Backwards?” “That's right． That's just what I said!”
    Slowly， carefully Mr． Smith began to write． It seemed a little strange to him． But the police captain must know what was correct． Mr． Smith wrote his name： HTIMS MAILLIW．

police captain 警官    backwards ? 向后地，相反地

倒着写名字
有一天，警察局来了个叫威廉姆&#8226;史密斯的人。他想办一张驾驶汽车的驾驶证。
警察局里办公桌后坐着一位警官。他不是个很客气的人。
“我想办张汽车驾驶证”，史密斯先生低声说。
“首先你必须填好这张卡，”警官说。他朝史密斯先生的方向扔过来一张白色的小卡片。“顶端填写你的姓名。”
“用墨水填？”史密斯先生很礼貌地问。
“当然，用墨水！”警官说，“先写姓，后写名。”
“怎么填？”史密斯说。他不明白负责人的意思。
“从后往前写姓名。姓在前，名在后。倒着写！”
“倒着写？”
“对。我就是这样说的！”
史密斯先生开始慢慢地、仔细地填写。他觉得这有点奇怪。但警官肯定知道怎么填写才是正确的。史密斯先生写下了他的姓名： HTIMS MAILLIW


Lesson40 Depression
    Everyone wants to be happy， but many things happen in our lives to make us sad． Our favourite pets can die， we can do poorly at school， close friends can move out of town． When a loved one dies or when we deal with divorce or other serious difficulties in life， we all feel sad for a time， and grieving can help us work through the problem． Sadness is an important way to cope with loss or tragedy．
    There's a difference， though， between the “depression” that most of us talk about when we talk about feeling sad， and the kind of depression that's very serious and sometimes life —threatening． The depression that may threaten our life is also known as clinical depression． It is about feeling so sad and hopeless that you sometimes can't imagine being happy． It's about being miserable so much of the time that you don't feel like participating in life． People who are chronically depressed usually have physical problems like stomachaches， headaches， and lack of energy． As you probably know， some people experience such deep depression that they believe suicide is the only way out of their pain．

depression ? 抑郁    divorce ? 离婚    grieving ? 悲痛
tragedy ? 灾难   clinical 临床的    participate ? 参加，参与
chronically 长期的    suicide ? 自杀

抑郁
每个人都想快乐，但是生活中许多事让我们悲伤。我们最喜爱的宠物死了，我们在学校成绩不好，亲密的朋友将搬离城镇。当爱人去世，生活中遇到离婚或其他重大的困难时，我们都会悲伤一段时间，忧伤可以帮我们度过这段困难时期。悲伤是应对失败或灾难的重要方法。
但是，我们大多数人在感到悲伤时所说的“抑郁”和那种非常严重有时甚至会威胁生命的“抑郁”是有差别的。
可能会威胁生命的抑郁也就是我们所知的临床上的抑郁症。它是指你感到极度悲伤绝望以至无法想象快乐，它是指你对生活感到痛苦以至不想继续活下去。长期抑郁的人经常有胃痛、头痛和疲惫等生理上的疾病。正如你可能知道的，一些人极度抑郁以至相信自杀是使他们脱离痛苦的唯一办法。


Lesson41 Spoken Languages
    The human mouth has three major functions． Two of them —eating and breathing — are shared by members of the animal kingdom． The third function — speaking — is one of the principal features which distinguish human beings from the rest of living creatures．
    Although primitive man must have had a spoken language， social scientists have no evidence of written language before the appearance of written records in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt 5-6 thousand years ago． Present-day linguists can identify over 1500 spoken languages．Chinese is the biggest language， spoken by more than a billion people． After Chinese， English is the most widely spoken first language， and has become the language of choice in international communication．
English has not always been the international language． Two hundred years ago French was the dominant language．In ancient times， Arabic，Greek and Latin were international languages at different points in time．
    Many people in history tried to create a common universal language for all peoples of the world． The most successful of such effort to date was Esperanto which was spoken by about 750，000 people at one time in the mid-20th century． However， such universal languages always fail in the end because of lack of a cultural foundation．

principal 主要的   distinguish ? 区分   primitive ? 原始的   Mesopotamia 美索不达米亚
linguist 语言学家   identify ? 认清，辨认   dominant 占统治地位的，占优势的
universal 通用的   foundation ? 基础

口语
人的嘴有三种主要功能。其中的两项——吃和呼吸，和动物王国的成员一样。第三项——说话，这是人类区别于其他生物的主要特征。
虽然原始人一定有口头语言，但是社会科学家没有证据证明在5到6千年前古美索不达米亚和埃及出现文字记录前人类就有文字了。如今的语言学家可以辨认1 
500多种口语。中文是最大的语言，有10亿多人说中文。紧随之后的是英语，它是使用最广泛的第一语言，也已经成为了国际交流中人们选择的语言。
英语并不一直是国际语言。两百年前法语是占统治地位的语言。在古代，阿拉伯语、希腊语和拉丁语是不同时期的国际语言。
历史上有许多人试图为世界各地的民族创造一种普遍通用的语言。迄今为止，此类努力中最成功的是世界语，在20世纪中叶曾一度有大约75万人使用它，但是这样的通用语言因为缺乏文化基础，最终都以失败告终。


Lesson42 Children Should Be Seen， Not Heard
    King Edward loved his grandchildren， but he treated them very strictly． They were not allowed to make too much noise， and they were not allowed to speak at table without their grandfather's permission．
    One day， they were having lunch with King Edward． He was talking to an important guest， the King of Sweden． He was so interested in the conversation that he paid little attention to what he was eating．
    Suddenly， one of his little grandsons said：“Grandpapa!”The king took no notice of this interruption， and went on talking to the King of Sweden．
“Grandpapa!” the little boy repeated， in a louder voice．
“Be quiet， David． It's impolite to interrupt the conversation of grown-ups．” “But Grandpapa!”
“Little boys should be seen but not heard，” said the King． 
“Wait until I've finished talking to the King of Sweden．”
So the little boy had to keep silent．
When King Edward finished his conversation with the King of Sweden， he turned to his little grandson and said： “Now， my little man， what did you want to tell me?”“Oh， it doesn't matter now，” answered the little boy． “I just wanted to tell you there was a slug on your lettuce， but you've eaten it now．”

interruption 打断    slug 鼻涕虫

男孩子应该安静地待在那里
爱德华国王很爱他的孙子孙女，但他对他们很严格，不允许他们发出很大的噪音，未经祖父允许不能在吃饭时说话。
一天，孩子们正在和爱德华国王一起吃午餐。国王和一位重要的客人——瑞典国王谈话。他沉浸于谈话之中以至于对自己所吃的东西没怎么在意。
突然，他的一个小孙子说，“祖父！”
国王没有注意到他的插话，继续和瑞典国王讲话。
“祖父！”小男孩更加大声地又喊了一次。
“安静点，大卫。打断大人的谈话是很不礼貌的。”“但是，祖父！”
“小孩子应该安静地待在那里，”国王说，“有什么等到我和瑞典国王谈完话再说。”
小男孩只好保持沉默。
当爱德华国王与瑞典国王谈完话后，他转向他的小孙子说：“我的小伙子，现在你想和我说什么？”
“哦，现在已经不重要了，”小男孩说，“我只是想告诉您，您的莴苣上有一条虫，不过您已经把它吃掉了。”


Lesson43 Theodore Roosevelt
    Theodore Roosevelt was the twenty-sixth president of the United States． He was president from 1901 to 1909． He was also a boxer， a soldier， a rancher， and an explorer．This energetic man was not strong when he was a boy． He suffered from asthma， a problem with breathing． His father wanted him to be strong． Roosevelt learned to box and did many other sports． Soon Roosevelt became strong and energetic．
    After he became president， Roosevelt kept his body strong． He even boxed in the White House． One day， another boxer hit him in the eye．After that accident， Roosevelt became blind in one eye．
    Theodore Roosevelt had a nickname called “Teddy．” When he was president，he often went hunting．One day he went hunting with some friends and saw a small bear． He did not shoot the bear． He said the bear was too small and must go free． The next day the story of the little bear was in the newspapers． The newspapers named the little bear “Teddy” after the president． 
    Soon people called toy bears for children “teddy bears．”When he left the White House， Teddy Roosevelt went to hunt in Africa． He then went to South America to explore places that nobody knew about．Americans loved his energy．

rancher ? 牧场主    asthma ? 哮喘

西奥多&#8226;罗斯福
西奥多．罗斯福是美国的第26位总统。他的任期从1901年到1909年。他还是一个拳击手，一名战士，一位牧场主和一个探险家。
罗斯福精力旺盛，但当他还是小男孩时他并不强壮。他患有哮喘，一种呼吸系统的疾病。他的父亲希望他变得强壮，所以罗斯福学习拳击及许多其他运动。很快他变得强壮且精力旺盛。
当罗斯福成为总统以后，他仍旧保持身体强健。他甚至在白宫里打拳击。一天，另一位拳击手打到了罗斯福眼部。在这次事故后，罗斯福瞎了一只眼睛。
罗斯福的昵称叫“特迪”。当他成为总统后，他经常去打猎。一天，他和一些朋友去打猎。他看到了一头小熊，他没有朝它射击。他说那熊还太小，它应该获得自由。第二天，这个关于小熊的故事上了报。报道将小熊按罗斯福的昵称命名为“特迪”。很快人们将孩子们玩的玩具熊称为“特迪小熊”。
当罗斯福离开白宫后，他去非洲打猎。他还去了南美没有人知道的地方探险。美国人喜欢他的精力旺盛。


Lesson44 Joyce's Story of Time Management
    Time management is the greatest challenge for me in high school． I have to balance my subjects， activities， social life， and rest． I often get into arguments with my family members just because I didn't plan my time well． For instance， I may yell at them for disturbing me when I'm working and I may blame them when I miss deadlines， even though it's actually my fault for cramming everything in at the last minute．
    There is one thing that I always make time for： watching TV． It's a way for me to relax． I think the best trick to deal with time management is the classic “break it into bits．” It's really important for you to learn how to break a big project into small， manageable tasks． Then you can work progressively and have a sense of achievement whenever you're done with a small part．
    Another trick is to devise a timetable for yourself． It doesn't have to be one that you follow faithfully． It's just there to serve as a guide． You can compare your actual schedule with the planned one to see how well you actually use your time． A final tip is to always set deadlines for yourself．

yell ? 大叫   deadline 最后期限    progressively ? 日益增多的
devise ? 设计    faithfully ? 忠诚地，如实地

乔伊斯管理时间的故事
在高中管理时间对于我来说是最大的挑战。我必须平衡各门课程的学习、活动、社交和休息时间。我经常和家人发生争执，仅仅是因为我没有很好地计划时间。例如，当我忙着时，如果他们打扰，我就会向他们大声嚷嚷，当我误了最后期限，我就会责怪他们，即使这都是我的错，因为我把所有的事都拖到最后一刻来做。 
有一件事总是占用我很多时间，那就是看电视。这是我放松的一个方法。我认为管理时间的最好诀窍就是经典的“分割时间”。学会如何将一个大项目分割成一些易处理的小任务是非常重要的。这样你就可以有条不紊地推进你的工作，而且每当你完成一小部分时，你都会有成就感。 
另一个诀窍就是为自己设计一张时间表，你不必严格地遵照它，它只是一个指导，你可以把你实际的时间表和这个计划进行比较，看看实际上你是如何利用时间的。最后一个窍门就是为自己设定一个最终期限。


Lesson45 Chocolate
    We now think of chocolates as sweet， but once it was bitter． Today we think of it as a candy， but once it was a medicine． Chocolate is a product of a cocoa tree． Its beans taste bitter． Workers must first dry and then roast them in order to remove the bitter taste．
    The word “chocolate” comes from a Mayan word． The Mayas were an ancient people who once lived in Mexico． They valued the cocoa tree． Some used the beans for money， while others 
crushed them to make a drink． When the Spaniards came to Mexico in the sixteenth century， they started drinking cacao too． Because the drink was strong and bitter， they thought it 
    was medicine． No one had the idea of adding sugar． The Spaniards took some beans back to Europe and opened cafes． 
Wealthy people drank cocoa and said it was good for the digestion．In the 1800s the owner of a chocolate factory in England discovered that sugar removed the bitter taste of cocoa． It quickly became a cheap and popular drink． Soon afterward， a factory made the first solid block of sweetened chocolate． Later on， another factory mixed milk and chocolate together．People like the taste of milk chocolate even better．

Maya 玛雅
Mayan ? 玛雅的，玛雅人的
crush ? 压碎，磨碎
Spaniard ? 西班牙人
digestion 消化

巧克力 
现在我们认为巧克力是甜的，但它曾经是苦的。现在我们认为它是一种糖果，但它曾经是药。巧克力是可可树上的产物。它的豆是苦的，工人们必须先将其弄干，然后经烘烤才能去除苦味。 
“巧克力”这个词来源于玛雅文字。玛雅是一个曾经居住在墨西哥的古老民族。玛雅人非常珍视可可树。一些人用可可豆当成货币，而另一些人将其磨碎做成饮料。16世纪西班牙人来到了墨西哥，他们也开始喝可可饮料。由于这种饮料味道浓而苦，他们认为它是药。没有人想到去加糖。西班牙人把一些可可豆带回欧洲，并开了咖啡馆。有钱人喝可可并声称它有助消化。 
19世纪一家英国巧克力厂的老板发现糖可以去除可可的苦味。可可立即成为了一种便宜、受欢迎的饮料。不久以后，一家工厂率先生产出了固体块状的甜味巧克力。后来，另一家工厂将牛奶和巧克力混合起来。人们更加喜欢牛奶巧克力的味道。



Lesson46 A Family Sees America Together
    The Graham family did something very unusual last year． Mr． and Mrs． Graham did not go to work， and their children did not go to school． Instead， the family travelled together in a van and drove across America for a whole year．
    First， they sold their family businesses in real estate and a small newspaper． Then they sold their large house． Finally， the children said good-bye to classmates． And their dream trip started on July 4th，Independence Day．They visited big cities and small towns in all 50 states． They also visited the birthplaces of all the United States' Presidents．They visited many interesting places， parks， and zoos， and also interviewed people on their way． Many people were very friendly． Some invited the family to stay in their home with them． Almost all the people they met signed their “guest book．”
    Each day， the mother and the daughter wrote stories of their trips for newspapers or their internet homepage． Schoolchildren from all over the United States followed the Graham family's trip by using computers at home and in school． Some children wrote letters to the Graham family．After the trip the family wrote a book about their travels to describe everything they learned about their country and its people．

van ? 面包车   estate ? 不动产    sign 签名于

一个走遍美国的家庭 
去年，格雷厄姆一家做了一件不寻常的事。格雷厄姆先生与太太没有去工作，他们的孩子也没有去上学，而是全家一起花了一年时间开车周游了美国。 
首先，他们卖掉了自己的房地产买卖和一家小报馆，然后又卖掉了大房子，最后，孩子们和同学们道别。他们的梦之旅从七月四日——美国独立日开始了。他们游览了五十个州的大小城镇。他们还拜访了所有总统的出生地。他们参观了许多有趣的地方、公园、动物园，沿途还采访了许多人。人们都很友好。有人邀请他们回家小住，几乎所有他们遇到的人都在他们的“访客留言”上签名。 
每天，母亲和女儿写下他们旅途的故事，寄给报社或贴在他们的网页上。全美国的孩子们通过家里或学校里的电脑，跟随着格雷厄姆一家旅游。一些孩子还写信给格雷厄姆一家。
旅行结束后，一家人写了一本游记，书中描写了他们了解到的祖国与人民。



Lesson47 Jaime Escalante
    Jaime Escalante was a teacher from Bolivia． He arrived in Los Angeles in 1963． He was thirty-three years old and spoke almost no English．
    Life was difficult for Escalante in the United States． He could not be a teacher in California． He had to go to college again． It took him many years， but he did it． He worked at a restaurant to support his family at the same time． Finally， when he was forty-three he started to work at Garfield High School in Los Angeles． This school had a bad name． There were many gangs and the students were not doing well． Soon Escalante changed things．
Escalante worked with his students． He taught them math． He used his own methods， and they worked． The students learned and enjoyed their math． In 1982， fourteen of his students passed an advanced math examination． Nobody believed this． 
    People said the students were cheating． The students wanted to show they were not cheating． They took the exam again． And they passed again． This was a miracle in a place like Garfield! This was the work of Jaime Escalante．
Every year Escalante produced top class students． People know him as one of the best teachers in America． There is even a movie and a book about him．

海梅&#8226;埃斯卡兰特
海梅&#8226;埃斯卡兰特是一位来自玻利维亚的教师。他于1963年来到洛杉矶。那时，他33岁，几乎一点英语都不会讲。 
对埃斯卡兰特来说，在美国的生活是艰苦的。在加利福尼亚他不能做老师，他不得不再次去读大学。这花了他许多年，但他坚持下来了。为了在学习的同时养家糊口，他在餐厅打工。最终，在43岁时，他开始在洛杉矶的加菲尔德高中工作。这所学校名声很坏，有很多小流氓，学生学习也不好。很快，埃斯卡兰特改变了这一切。 
埃斯卡兰特与他的学生们一起努力。他教他们数学，他用他自己的方法，这些方法很灵。学生们很喜欢学习数学。1982年，他学生中的十四位通过了高等数学的考试。没有人相信这一切。人们说这些学生一定作弊了。学生们要证明自己没有作弊，他们又重新参加了考试，他们又通过了。这样的事在像加菲尔德这样的学校简直是奇迹！这些都是海梅&#8226;埃斯卡兰特的功劳。
每年埃斯卡兰特都培养出顶尖的学生。人们把他当作美国最好的老师之一，甚至有一部电影和一本书讲述了埃斯卡兰特的故事。


Lesson48 A Little Girl's Combat against Depression
    When I was in 6th grade， a week before Thanksgiving， there was a fire at my house． I lost all my stuffed animals， including the one I was particularly attached to， my beloved green rabbit． Losing most of my belongings， having to live in a hotel (for a year) and the other stresses that go along with beginning a new school， I was crushed． I began to have trouble going to school and became sick a lot． I became very depressed and at times wishing I could die．
    The counselor at school suggested that I keep a journal about my feelings as a way to express my emotions． I did， and I still have that journal to this day as a reminder of that terrible time in my life． With the support of my counselor， a psychologist， my parents and my journal， I was able to overcome this depression．
    About a year later most of the feelings were gone， although I still felt a longing for my rabbit． Now， eight years later， life has gone on but it's still hard for me when I remember the fire and those past feelings．I'm glad that I'm still here today， alive and well， and as much as I thought I wouldn't be able， I am happy again．

一个小女孩与抑郁症的斗争 
当我六年级时，感恩节前一周，我家发生了火灾。我失去了所有的填充动物玩具，包括一只我特别喜爱的绿色的兔子。我失去了几乎所有的东西，不得不在旅店里住了一年，还要适应新学校的压力，我被压垮了。我开始不能上学，总是生病。我变得非常抑郁，有时希望自己死去。 
学校里的辅导员建议我把自己的感觉写下来，以这种方式表达情绪。我这样做了，我至今仍保留了这本日记，它使我难以忘记生命中那段艰难的时光。在辅导员、心理学家、父母和日记的支持下，我终于克服了抑郁。 
一年以后，大多数抑郁的感觉都不见了，虽然我仍旧很想念我的兔子。现在，八年过去了，生活还在继续，但当我回想起那场大火和过去的那些感觉时我仍感到痛苦。我很高兴我现在仍在这里，活得很好，从前我几乎认为自己再也不能这样了，我又重新快乐了起来。

    Thomas Alva Edison was born in 1847． He was sick a lot when he was young． Edison's mother taught him lessons at home and he only studied the things he wanted to know． At age ten， he read his first science book．After he read the book， he built a laboratory in his house．Soon，Edison started to invent things． 
    He was interested in the telegraph and electricity． At age twenty-three， he made a special telegraphic machine and sold it for a lot of money． With this money， he was now free to invent all the time．
    Edison started his own laboratory at Menlo Park， New Jersey． He hired mechanics and chemists to help him． He worked day and night． Once， He worked on forty-five inventions at the same time． Edison did not sleep very much， but he took naps． He often fell asleep with his clothes on． One day， he even fell asleep in a closet!
    Did you know Edison invented wax paper， fire alarms， the battery， and motion pictures? By far his favourite invention was the record player． His other famous invention was the light bulb． Edison died in 1931， at the age of eighty-four． He had over 1，300 inventions to his name! Many people say that Edison was a genius — one of the smartest people in the world!

托玛斯&#8226;阿尔瓦&#8226;爱迪生 
托玛斯&#8226;阿尔瓦&#8226;爱迪生出生于1847年。小时候他总是生病。爱迪生的母亲在家教他读书，他只学他想学的东西。10岁时他读了第一本科学书籍。在读完这本书以后，他在家里建了个实验室。很快爱迪生开始发明创造。他对电报和电力很感兴趣。23岁时，他发明了一种特殊的电报机并卖了很多钱。有了这些钱，他就可以一直无忧无虑地搞发明创造了。 
爱迪生在新泽西的门洛帕克建立了自己的实验室。他雇佣了机械工和化学师帮忙。他没日没夜地工作。有一次，他同时致力于45个发明的研究。爱迪生睡觉睡得不多，但他常打瞌睡。他经常穿着衣服就睡着了。一天他竟然在壁橱里睡着了！ 
你知道是爱迪生发明了蜡纸、火警警报器、电池和电影吗？他最中意的发明是电唱机。他另一个著名的发明是电灯泡。爱迪生于1931年去世，享年84岁。他一共有1 300多种发明创造！许多人说爱迪生是个天才——他是世界上最聪明的人之一！


Lesson50 Yellowstone National Park
    A national park is a large piece of land where animals are free to come and go． Trees and plants grow everywhere． People go to a national park to enjoy nature． Many people stay in campgrounds in national parks． They sleep in tents and cook their food over campfires． They also walk on trails or paths in the parks． On a gate at the entrance of Yellowstone， a sign says， “For the Benefit and Enjoyment of the People．”
    Yellowstone is the world's oldest national park． It became a national park in 1872． It is also the world's largest park． It covers parts of the states of Wyoming， Montana， and Idaho． Yellowstone is two-and-a-half times the size of the smallest state， Rhode Island．
    Yellowstone is famous for its geysers． These holes in the ground shoot hot water into the air． There are about seventy geysers in the park． The most famous is Old Faithful． About every hour Old Faithful shoots hot water hundreds of feet into the air．Two-and-a-half million people visit this beautiful park each year． Park rangers give information to visitors． They also take care of the park． They tell visitors not to pick the flowers． They also tell them not to feed or hunt the animals．

黄石国家公园

国家公园是一大片动物可以自由走动的土地。到处都生长着树木植物。人们可以在其中享受自然。许多人在国家公园里露营。他们睡在帐篷里，用篝火烧食物。人们在公园的小径上散步。在黄石国家公园进口，大门上写着这样一条标语：“为了人们的利益与快乐。” 
黄石国家公园是世界上最早的国家公园，始于1872年。它还是世界上最大的公园。它横跨怀俄明州、蒙大拿州和爱达荷州的部分地方。黄石国家公园是最小的州罗得岛州的2?5倍。 
黄石国家公园的间歇泉非常有名。这些地下的洞将热水喷射到空中。公园里大约有70座间歇泉，其中最著名的是老信徒。大约每隔1小时它就会将热水喷射到几百英尺高的空中。 
每年都有250多万人前来参观这个美丽的公园。公园管理员会为游客提供信息。他们同时也照看这个公园。他们告诉游客不要摘花，不要喂食或射猎动物。


Lesson51 Swimming
    Swimming is a competitive sport played around the world and on many different levels， including the Olympics． It's also an easy sport to do on your own， both for fun and for exercise．
    Many doctors and athletes agree that swimming is one of the best workouts you can give your body， because it works almost on all of your major muscle groups at the same time． Since you're floating in the water and not in contact with any hard surfaces， there's less pressure on your joints and bones． 
    You're less likely to suffer injuries than with other sports．There are many ways to push yourself and get better as a swimmer． If you're into speed， you can race the clock and see how long it takes you to do a certain number of laps． If you're into endurance， you can slow down and see how many laps you can do before you have to take a rest． Many teenagers like swimming best． One of the students says， “The best part about swimming is when you beat your time． It doesn't even matter if you lose the race as long as you tried your best； you can walk away with a smile on your face． When you're in the water you forget that people may be watching and all you care about is getting to the other side of the pool and touching the wall． You can just let go and fly．”

游泳 
游泳是世界流行的竞技运动，有许多不同级别的游泳比赛，包括奥运会级别的。游泳也是一种自己就可以进行的简单运动，可以游着玩玩，也可以锻炼身体。 
许多医生和运动员认为游泳是你可以给予自己身体的最好的锻炼之一，因为它几乎同时调动了你所有的主要肌肉群。由于你浮在水面上，不接触任何坚硬的表面，你的关节和骨骼受到比较小的压力，比起其他运动，游泳受伤的可能性比较小。 
有许多方法可以推动你成为一个更好的游泳者。如果你想练速度，你可以用表计时，看你游一定的圈数需用时多少。如果你想练耐力，你可以放慢速度，看在不得不休息前你可以游多少圈。游泳是许多青少年最喜欢的运动。一个学生说：“游泳最开心的时候是打破自己记录的时候。是否赢得比赛根本不重要，只要你尽了最大的努力，你就可以笑着离开了。当你在水中时，你会忘记注视着你的人，你所关心的只是到达泳池的另一边，碰到池壁。你可以不顾一切地飞翔。”


Lesson52 Cheerleaders
    When you go to a college or high school sports event， you see cheerleaders． Cheerleaders are male and female students dressed in the colours of their team． They jump and dance in front of the crowd and shout the name of their team． Their job is to excite the crowd．
    The first cheerleader was a man． In 1898， Johnny Campbell jumped in front of the crowd at the University of Minnesota and shouted for his team． He shouted， “Hoo-rah Minn-e-so-tah!” 
    This was the first organized shout， or “yell．” For the next thirty-two years cheerleaders were men only． Women were not cheerleaders until 1930．
    Today cheerleaders work in teams． They practice special shouts，dances，and athletic shows．Often the women work separately from the men．But cheerleaders are most exciting when men and women work together．The men throw the women high in the air and catch them． The team members climb on each other's shoulders to make a human pyramid． They yell and dance too． It is like human fireworks．
    Cheerleaders now have their own contests． Every year there are local， state， and national contests for cheerleaders． The teams make new， faster， and more exciting shows to be the best．

cheerleader ? 啦啦队员   athletic ? 运动的   pyramid ? 金字塔   contest ? 比赛

啦啦队 
当你观看一所大学或高中的体育赛事时，你就会看到啦啦队。啦啦队员可以是男生也可以是女生，他们穿着与队伍颜色一样的衣服，在观众席前又蹦又跳，高喊自己队伍的名字。他们的工作就是使观众兴奋起来。 
第一个啦啦队员是男性。1898年，约翰尼&#8226;坎贝尔在明尼苏达大学观看比赛时，跳到观众前面为自己的队伍呐喊。他大叫：“Hoo-rah Minn-e-so-tah！”这是第一个有组织的呐喊或欢呼。在后来的32年中啦啦队员一直是男性。直到1930年，女性才开始成为啦啦队员。 
如今，啦啦队组成团队，他们练习特殊的呐喊语、舞蹈和运动表演。女性经常与男性分开表演，但是当他们在一起表演时才是最激动人心的。男性把女性抛到高空中然后再接住她们。啦啦队员们一个踩着另一个人的肩膀叠成人造金字塔。他们还欢呼、跳舞。这就像是由人做成的烟火。
现在啦啦队也有自己的比赛。每年都有地方的、州立的、全国的比赛。每个队伍都拿出最新、最快、最令人激动的表演争取获得第一。


Lesson53 A Seeing — eye Dog
    A seeing-eye dog is a special dog which helps blind people． We call these dogs “seeing-eye” dogs because the dogs are the “eyes” of the blind man and they help him to “see”． These dogs generally go to special schools for several years of training．
    One day a seeing-eye dog and a blind man got on a bus together． The bus was full of people and there were no seats． One man， however， soon got up and left his seat． The dog took the blind man to the seat， but there was very little space． 
    The dog began to push the people on each side with his nose． He pushed and pushed until the people moved down and finally there was enough space for two people． The blind man then sat down and the dog got up on the seat next to him． He lay down and put his head on the leg of the blind man． He was very comfortable and soon fell asleep．
Everyone on the bus smiled at the intelligence of the dog in making space for the blind man and， at the same time， making a place for himself．

代目狗 
代目狗是专门用来帮助盲人的导盲犬。我们把这种导盲犬称之为“代目狗”，因为它们是盲人的“眼睛”，帮助他们“看”东西。通常，这些狗要到特殊的学校接受几年的训练。 
一天，一只导盲犬和一个盲人一起乘坐巴士。巴士上坐满了人，没有剩余的座位。不过，很快有个人站起来，离开了座位。导盲犬领盲人走到座位，但座位那里的空间很小。导盲犬开始用鼻子推两边的人。它推呀，推呀，直到人们退后，空出了两个人的地方。盲人于是坐在座位上，而狗则爬上紧靠盲人的座位。它躺着把头放在盲人的腿上。它很舒服，不久便进入了梦乡。巴士上的人对导盲犬的聪明发出会心的微笑，它不仅为盲人找到了地方，同时也为自己找到一席之地。


Lesson54 Helen Keller
    Helen Keller was born in Alabama in 1880． When she was twenty months old， she got an illness． After her illness Helen became deaf and blind. Her parents did not know what to do．
    When Helen was seven years old， her parents got her a special teacher． Her name was Miss Anne Sullivan． Miss Sullivan worked with Helen all day． She took Helen's hand and spelled a word in her hand． Helen soon learned to say what she wanted in this way．
    In 1900 Helen entered Radcliffe College． Miss Sullivan sat next to Helen in class． She spelled all the words into Helen's hand． Miss Sullivan also read to Helen all the time． At that time there were only a few books for the blind． These were Braille books． They had a special alphabet made with dots that blind people could read with their fingers． Helen graduated from Radcliffe with honours．
    Helen wrote several books． The most famous ones are The Story of My Life and Midstream： My Later Life． She also wrote magazine articles and spoke all over the country． It was not easy to understand her． Miss Sullivan repeated what Helen said． Helen spoke about the deaf and blind． People everywhere became interested． Helen became a symbol of new hope for the deaf and blind．

海伦&#8226;凯勒
海伦&#8226;凯勒于1880年出生在阿拉巴马。当她20个月时她生了一场病，病后她变得又聋又瞎，她的父母束手无策。 
当海伦7岁时，她的父母给她请来了一个特殊的老师，名叫安妮&#8226;沙利文小姐。沙利文小姐整天和海伦一起学习。她拉着海伦的手，在她手上拼写单词。海伦很快学会以这种方式表达她想表达的意思。 
1900年海伦进入了拉德克里夫学院。课堂上沙利文小姐坐在海伦旁边。她把所有单词拼写在海伦手上。沙利文小姐还一直给海伦朗读。那时，专门给盲人阅读的书籍非常少，盲文书籍是以点构成的特殊的字母，盲人可以通过用手指触摸这些点来阅读。海伦以优异的成绩从拉德克里夫学院毕业。 
海伦写了几本书，其中最著名的是《我的一生》和《我的后半生》。她还写了许多杂志文章，在世界各地演讲。听懂她说话不是件容易的事，沙利文小姐重复海伦的话。海伦谈论聋哑人和盲人。各地的人都很感兴趣。海伦成为了聋哑人和盲人新的希望的象征。


Lesson55 At Dinner Table
    As any homemaker knows， there is far more to a family meal than food． Sociologists have been studying families to find out just how much more．
    Lewis and his co-workers carried out their study by videotaping the families while they ate ordinary meals in their own homes． They found that parents with small families talk actively with each other and their children． But as the number of children gets larger， conversation gives way to the parent's efforts to control the loud noise they make． That can have an important effect on the children． “In general the more question-asking the parents do the higher the children's IQ scores，” Lewis says． “And the more children there are， the less question-asking there is．”
    The study also provides an explanation for why middle children often seem to have a harder time in life than their siblings． Lewis found that in families with three or four children， dinner conversation is likely to centre on the oldest child， who has the most to talk about， and the youngest， who needs the most attention “Middle children are invisible，” says Lewis． “When you see someone get up from the table and walk around during dinner， chances are it's the middle child．” 
There is， however，one thing that stops all conversation and prevents anyone from having attention：“When the TV is on，” Lewis says， “dinner is non-existent．”

餐桌上
正如每个主妇都知道的，一顿家餐并不只是食物那么简单。社会学家已经开始研究家庭以更多地了解家餐所起的作用。 
刘易斯和他的同事通过录影家庭平时在家吃饭的情况进行研究。他们发现小家庭中父母喜欢互相交谈并和孩子们说话。但是当孩子多了以后，谈话减少了，取而代之的是父母们努力控制孩子不要发出噪音，这对孩子们的影响很大。“总的来说，父母问题问得越多，孩子的IQ越高。” 
研究还解释了中间的孩子的生活为什么似乎总是比他们的兄弟姐妹艰难一些。刘易斯发现在有三四个孩子的家庭里，餐桌上的话题总是集中在最大和最小的孩子身上，最大的孩子可说的事情最多，而最小的孩子最需要关注。“中间的孩子被人忽视，”刘易斯说，“当你看到有个人在吃饭时起身离开餐桌四处走动，这个人很可能就是中间的孩子。”然而，有一样东西可以使所有的谈话停止，分散大家的注意力。“当电视打开时，” 
刘易斯说，“晚餐就不存在了。”


Lesson56 It's the Television!
    Ted had not seen his old friend Sam since they were at school together． One day Ted saw Sam at a business meeting in a big hotel．
“Hi， Sam!” Ted said happily． “How are you?”
“I'm very well， thank you， Ted，” Sam answered， “and how are you?”
“Not too bad， thank you，” Ted said， they sat down side by side and began to talk．
    Gradually their topic turned to television．Ted said，“I think it's very bad for people． When I was a young man， we did things ourselves — we didn't just watch other people． In the evenings， we sang songs or played music or cards with each other or we read the newspaper or found ourselves something useful to do．”
    Sam nodded． “Yes， that's true， and perhaps once a week or once a month we went into the town specially to see a film in the cinema， and maybe to buy ourselves an ice cream．”
     “And now，” Ted went on， “my children watch silly films on television almost every evening， and they don't do the work that their teachers give them． What will they do with themselves when they leave school?”
“Yes， it's very bad， isn't it?” Sam said． “But what can we do about it?”
“Well，” Ted answered， “I've promised myself one thing： I'm going to sell our television set — as soon as the football season finishes at the end of this month．”

这就是电视！
自从特德和他的老朋友莎姆离开一起读书的学校后他们就再没有见过面。一天，特德在一家大酒店的商务会议上看到了莎姆。
“你好，莎姆！”特德高兴地说，“你怎么样啊？”
“我很好，谢谢，特德，” 莎姆回答说，“你怎么样呢？”
“我也不错，谢谢，”特德说，他们并排坐着，开始谈话。
慢慢地他们的话题转到了电视上。
特德说，“我认为电视对人们非常有害。当我年轻时，我们自己做事——不仅仅是看别人。傍晚，我们唱歌，玩音乐，打牌，看报纸或者找些有意义的事做。
莎姆点头表示同意。”是的，的确如此，我们一星期或一个月去一次城里，专程去看电影，或是给自己买个冰激凌。”
“可是现在，”特德继续说，“我的孩子几乎每天晚上都看电视里那些愚蠢的电影，他们不做老师布置的功课。他们毕业后会做些什么啊？”
“是的，确实很糟糕，” 莎姆说，“但是我们又有什么办法呢？”
“是啊，”特德回答说，“我已经决定，这月末足球赛季一结束我就把电视机卖了。”


Lesson57 A Little Kite
“I never can do it，” the little kite said，
As he looked at the others high over his head；
“I know I should fall if I tried to fly．”
“Try，” said the big kite， “Only try!
Or I fear you never will learn at all． ”
But the little kite said， “I'm afraid I'll fall．”
The big kite nodded：“Ah， well， good-bye；
I'm off．” And he rose toward the cloudless sky．
Then the little kite's paper stirred at the sight，
And trembling， he shook himself free for flight．
First whirling and frightened， then braver grown，
Up， up he rose through the air alone，
Till the big kite， looking down， could see
The little one rising steadily．
Then how the little kite thrilled with pride，
As he sailed with the big kite side by side!
While far below he could see the ground，
And the boys， like small spots moving round．
They rested high in the quiet air，
And only the joyful birds were there．
“Oh， how happy I am!” the little kite cried，
“And all because I was brave， and tried．”

一只小风筝
“我从来都做不到。”小风筝说，当他看到头顶上高空中的其他风筝时。
“我知道如果我要飞的话，我会摔下来。”“试试，”大风筝说，“只是试一下！
否则我恐怕你永远都学不会。”但小风筝说：“我害怕会掉下来。”
大风筝点点头说：“哦，好吧，再见。我要飞了。”然后他升向万里无云的天空。
看到这以后，小风筝身上的纸开始动起来。颤颤悠悠他让自己自由地飞了起来。
开始时旋转着，很害怕，然后变得更勇敢了。上升，上升，他独自在空中升起。
直到大风筝往下看，看到小风筝正平稳地上升。
当小风筝和大风筝肩并肩一起飞翔时，他是多么自豪地抖动着身体啊！
而在很远的下面，他能看到大地，还有男孩子们，他们像一个个小点一样四处移动。
他们在安静的、高高的空中休息，那里只有快乐的小鸟。
“哦，我是多么快乐啊！”小风筝叫起来，“这都是因为我很勇敢，我敢于尝试。”


Lesson58 It's Time to Breathe Fresh Air
    Golden sunshine and gentle breeze means the arrival of autumn， the most beautiful season of a year． This is a great time to go outside and have fun． Go to a valley to see red maple trees， go and pick fruit in an orchard or find an open field to fly your kite in．
    However， for many high school students， these great activities may be just a dream． With plenty of work to do， they spend all their hours indoors， struggling for a high mark in their exams． Of course， study is one of the most important things for teenagers． Life is definitely much more than that．
    Going out and enjoying the beautiful countryside often helps our creativity in our work． Chinese craftsman Lu Ban invented a saw to help woodworkers． But if he hadn't walked outside， he would not have been inspired by a kind of toothed grass． We could also suppose if Newton hadn't rested under that apple tree， he wouldn't have been hit by an apple， and his classic theories would not have come out． Going out is not only a break from work， but a chance to enrich life experience． So come on， give your brain a good rest． Step out of the books and get your bag ready for an autumn outing． You will get much more knowledge out of the exciting journey．

breeze ? 微风   maple 枫叶  orchard 果园   definitely 确实地
craftsman ? 工匠    inspire ? 激发，启示   toothed ? 锯齿状的

呼吸新鲜空气 
金色的阳光、阵阵的微风是秋天的使者。秋天是一年中最美的季节，是外出游玩的好时光。去山谷看看红叶，去果园采摘水果或者去开阔的田野里放风筝。 
然而。对许多高中生来说，这些活动可能只是个梦。有那么多功课要做，他们只能整天待在室内，为了考高分而挣扎。当然，学习对于十几岁的年轻人来说是最重要的事之一。但是，生活不仅仅只是学习。 
出去享受一下美丽的田园风光可以帮助我们在工作中更有创造力。中国工匠鲁班发明了木工使用的锯子。但是如果他不走出家门，他就不能受到一种锯齿状的草的启发。我们还可以假设如果牛顿没有在苹果树下休息，他就不可能被苹果打中，也就没有经典理论的诞生。出去走走不仅是工作之余的放松，也是丰富人生经验的机会。所以，出来走走吧，让大脑好好休息一下。走出书本，整理行囊去秋游吧，你将会从精彩的旅行中获得更多的知识。


Lesson59 Harriet Tubman and Underground Railroad
    Harriet Tubman was born around 1820 in the South of the United States． She was an African-American and a slave． In those days in the South， African-Americans were slaves． People bought slaves to work in their houses， farms， and fields． Their masters bought and sold them like property． When Harriet became a young woman， she wanted to be free． She wanted to escape to the North of the United States． Everyone in the North was free．
    Finally， Harriet Tubman escaped to the North on the Underground Railroad． The Underground Railroad was not a real railroad． It was a secret organization of people． These people helped slaves to escape． At night， they took the slaves to a safe house． The slaves hid there． The next night， they took the slaves to the next house or “station” on the railroad． The word underground can mean secret． This is why people called the organization the Underground Railroad．
    When Harriet Tubman was free， she decided to help other slaves． She joined the Underground Railroad． Soon she became its leader． It was a very dangerous job． She went back to the South time after time． She brought back slaves to freedom in the North． Before Harriet Tubman died in 1913， she helped 300 slaves to escape． She helped these people begin new lives as free men and women． Today， Americans honour the name of this brave woman．

African-American 美国黑人   slave ? 奴隶   property 财产，所有物   organization ? 组织

哈里特&#8226;图博门和地下铁路 
哈里特&#8226;图博门约于1820年出生在美国南方。她是一个美国黑人，也是一个奴隶。那时在南方，美国黑人都是奴隶。人们买来奴隶，让他们在自己的家里、农场和田地里干活。他们的主人把他们像财产一样买卖。当哈里特年轻时，她就向往自由。她想逃到美国北部去。在北方人人都是自由的。 
最终，哈里特借助地下铁路逃到了北方。地下铁路不是真正的铁路。这是一个秘密组织，帮助奴隶逃跑。晚上，他们把奴隶带到安全的房子里，把奴隶藏在那里。第二天晚上，他们把奴隶带到下一个房子，也就是铁路上的“站”。“地下”就是秘密的意思。这就是为什么人们把这个组织叫做地下铁路的原因。 
当哈里特自由后，她决定帮助其他奴隶。她加入了地下铁路的组织。很快她成为了组织的领袖。这是一个非常危险的工作。她一次又一次地回到南方，把奴隶带到北方使他们获得自由。在哈里特1913年去世前，她共帮助了300个奴隶逃跑。她帮助他们获得自由，开始新的生活。如今美国人仍非常尊敬这位勇敢的女性。


Lesson60 A Laconic Answer
    In ancient times there was a race of people called the Spartans living in the southern part of Greece． They were noted for their simple habits and their bravery． The name of their land was Laconia， and so they were sometimes called Lacons． One of the strange rules which the Spartans had was that they should speak briefly， and never use more words than were needed． So a short answer is often spoken of as being Laconic， that is， as being such an answer as a Lacon would be likely to give．
    In the northern part of Greece there was a land called Macedon， and this land was at a time ruled over by a warlike king named Philip．Philip of Macedon wanted to become the master of all Greece． So he raised a great army， and made war upon the other states， until nearly all of them were forced to call him their king． Then he sent a letter to the Spartans in Laconia， and said， “If I go down into your country，I will level your great city to the ground．”
    In a few days， an answer was brought back to him． When he opened the letter， he found only one word written there． That word was “IF”．It was as much as to say， “We are not afraid of you so long as the little word ‘if’ stands in your way．”

bravery ? 勇敢    level 使……变成平地    laconic ? 简洁的

简洁的回答 
在古代，有一个生活在希腊南部的种族叫做斯巴达。他们以简朴的习惯和勇敢著称。他们的地方叫做拉哥尼亚。斯巴达人有一个奇怪的规矩就是他们说话必须简洁，从不多用一个不该用的词。所以简单的回答被称作为Laconic（简洁的），也就是拉哥尼亚人可能会给出的答案。
在希腊北部，有一个叫作马其顿的地方，这地方曾一度被一个好战的国王菲利浦所统治。
马其顿王国的菲利浦希望成为整个希腊的统治者。所以他招募军队，向其他国家开战，直到几乎所有的国家都被迫尊他为王。然后他写了封信给拉哥尼亚的斯巴达人说：“如果我打进你们的国家，我会把你们伟大的城邦夷为平地。”
几天后，菲利浦收到了回信。当他打开信，他发现里面只写着一个词“如果”。
这就是说，“只要‘如果’那个小词还在那里，我们就不会被你吓倒。”


Lesson61 Life in the Army
    Sam and Jack often talk about their days in the army． It was a hard life． The men had to get up early in the morning and do a lot of physical labour． They had to learn how to use a gun， and they had to march at least ten miles a day． There wasn't much entertainment； they had to do without television or radio． The only form of recreation they had was sports．
They only made about $40 a month， so they didn't have to worry about where to spend their money． Fortunately， they didn't have to pay any bills since the army paid their expenses． And they didn't have to do their own cooking； the army took care of that， too． In fact， the army took care of everything． The men never had to plan what they were going to do each day since the army did it for them．
    They had very little freedom in the beginning， but after the first six weeks the situation started to improve． The men didn't have to stay at the base all the time． They could go out on the weekends and see their girlfriends — something Sam and Jack did as often as possible． Jack didn't like being in the army since he didn't like taking orders． But Sam never complained． He thought being in the army was a good experience， and that every man should serve his country．

march ? 行军，行进   recreation 消遣， 娱乐    do without 免去……
bill ? 帐单   base ? 基地    take order 服从指挥

军营生活 
萨姆和杰克经常谈论他们在军队里的时光。那段生活很苦。清晨，他们必须早早地起床，并要做很多体力劳动；他们必须学习如何使用枪，并且每天至少行军十英里；那里娱乐活动很少，他们不得不过着没有电视或收音机的生活。唯一的消遣方式是体育运动。 
他们一个月仅收入40美元，因此也不用考虑把钱花在什么地方。幸运的是，他们不必支付任何账单，因为军队为其开支付费。而且不用自己做饭，军队也管饭。事实上，军队料理每一件事。军人们从不用计划每天该做什么，因为军队为他们计划好了。 
开始他们的自由很少，但是六周以后，情况有所改善。他们不必时时刻刻呆在基地，周末可以外出和探访女友——萨姆和杰克尽可能经常得到这样的机会。因为不愿意被人指挥，杰克不喜欢军营生活。但萨姆从不抱怨。他认为在军营中的生活是美好的一段经历，而且人人都应该为自己的国家服务。



Lesson62 The Echo in My Hometown
    Twain and two friends once were sitting in a restaurant． One friend said that the air in the mountains of his hometown was very clear． In many places the echo of a voice came back five times stronger than the original voice．
    The second friend said that was nothing． In his hometown the echo of a voice spoken in the morning came back in the afternoon． Mark Twain laughed． Then he said：“Listen! The echoes which you have told about are very unusual． But in a small church in my hometown there is an echo more unusual even than those．”
“What is so strange about the echo there?” asked one of the men．
“Well， I'll tell you，” said Mark Twain． “The echo in that church is so unusual that if one asks in a loud voice， ‘Good morning! How are you?’ the echo replies after a moment very clearly， ‘very well， thank you． And how are you?’”

echo 回声    original ? 最初的，原来的

我家乡的回声 
有一次，马克&#8226;吐温和两个朋友坐在一家餐馆。其中一个朋友说他家乡山上的空气很清洁。在许多地方，声音的回声以高于原来声音的五倍返回。
第二个朋友说这不算什么。在他的家乡，早晨发出的声音，其回声要在下午才能听到。马克&#8226;吐温大笑起来，然后他说： 
“听着！你们说的回声是很不一般。但是在我家乡的一个教堂，甚至有比那更稀奇的回声。”
“那儿的回声有什么奇特之处？”
“好，我这就告诉你，”马克&#8226;吐温说，“那个教堂里的回声非常不寻常，如果有人大声问： 
‘早上好！你好吗？’过一会儿，回声会很清楚的回答，‘我很好，谢谢。你怎么样？


Lesson63 A Plane Crash
    Nancy Paine has been a pilot for many years． She is an old friend of Otis Jackson's and is supporting his election campaign． Yesterday， Nancy was flying her twin-engine plane over the city with a sign saying Otis For Mayor． Around two o'clock it started getting cloudy， and Nancy decided to go back to the airport．
    Suddenly， her right engine started having problems． It died in less than a minute． Nancy became frightened when the plane started losing height． She flew into some heavy clouds and was able to see only a short distance ahead of her． When the clouds disappeared， her plane was just a few hundred feet above the ground． Nancy saw a wheat field in the distance and tried to land there． Unfortunately， her plane was going too fast and she wasn't able to land where she wanted to． She crashed into a barn on the other side of the field．
    The barn belonged to Alan Cooper， who was feeding his chickens when he heard the noise． Alan ran over to the barn and found Nancy inside the plane． She had a broken leg and wasn't able to move． Although she was badly hurt， Nancy was able to explain what happened． Alan opened the door of the plane and gently pulled her out． He laid Nancy on a pile of hay and tried to make her comfortable． Then he ran to the farmhouse and called an ambulance．

飞机失事 
南茜&#8226;佩恩做飞行员很多年了。她是奥蒂斯&#8226;杰克逊的一个老朋友，并且正为他的竞选运动助选。昨天，南茜驾驶着她的双引擎飞机在城市上空飞行，飞机上带有“选奥蒂斯当市长”的标语。大约两点钟，天气开始变得多云，南茜决定飞返机场。 
突然，飞机右面的发动机出了故障，不到一分钟就熄灭了。飞机开始下降，南茜感到害怕起来。她飞进了厚厚的云层里，仅能看见前方很短的距离。飞出云层后，她的飞机距离地面仅有几百英尺。南茜看到远处有块麦地，于是试图在那里降落。不幸的是，飞机速度太快，她没能降在想要降落的地方。她坠落到了麦地另一边的谷仓里。 
谷仓属于埃伦&#8226;库伯，听到响声时，他正在喂鸡。埃伦跑到谷仓，发现了飞机里的南茜。她的腿断了，不能动。虽然受了重伤，南茜还能解释发生了什么事。埃伦打开飞机门，轻轻地把她拉出来。他把南茜平放在一堆干草上，尽量使她舒适。然后他跑到农舍打电话叫了救护车。


Lesson64 The Brand Name Battle
    A week before the start of the new school year， Megan went clothes shopping with her mom． There was one item that Megan really wanted： a hooded sweatshirt from designer Jack Joy， who's the hottest brand name of the year．The hoodie looked awesome， with the name “Joy” written in huge letters on the back． Megan could picture herself wearing it in the school halls， turning heads and making all the other girls jealous． Plus， the price tag said the hoodie used to be $200．00， and then it was marked down to $150．00． What a bargain!Megan's mom， on the other hand， thought that $150．00 was a ridiculous price for one sweatshirt， especially since Megan already owned a similar one． It didn't have the Joy logo， but it was the same colour and quality， and looked great with jeans or even a skirt．
    The hoodie debate turned into a big argument． Megan's mom got so frustrated that she handed Megan the $200．00 to buy what she wanted． Megan quickly bought the Jack Joy hoodie， and with the remaining $50．00， got one pair of jeans．
On the first day of school， Megan got some positive comments on her pink Joy hoodie， but nothing like the reaction she had expected． Then she saw that two other girls were also wearing it， and she felt like a trend follower instead of a trendsetter． From then on， she was embarrassed to have it on．

品牌之战 
在新学年开始的一星期前，梅根和母亲一起去买衣服。有一件衣服梅根很喜欢，这是一件杰克&#8226;乔伊设计的连帽运动衫，这是今年最流行的品牌。 
这件连帽运动衫看上去非常棒，背后写着巨大的“Joy”的字母。梅根想象着她穿着这件衣服出现在学校大厅时，她一转过头去，其他所有的女孩都会嫉妒。此外，价格标签上写着这件衣服本来要买两百美元，现在降价到一百五十美元。实在是便宜货啊！
然而梅根的妈妈却觉得，对一件运动衫来说一百五十实在是个荒谬的价格，而且梅根已经有一件差不多的衣服了。那件衣服没有Joy的标志，但是一样的颜色，一样的质量，而且和牛仔裤或裙子配起来很好看。 
连帽运动衫的争论转变成了一场争吵。梅根的母亲感到非常生气，她丢给梅根两百美元让她自己去买想买的东西。梅根很快地买了杰克&#8226;乔伊的连帽运动衫，然后用剩下的五十美元买了一条牛仔裤。 
开学第一天，梅根的粉红色杰克连帽运动衫得到了一些好评，但是并没有引起她所期望的反响。然后她看到其他两个女孩也穿着同样的衣服，她感到自己穿这件衣服是个跟屁虫而不是引领者。从那以后，她再也不愿意穿那件衣服了。


Lesson65 Money Talks
    Ben Fix used to be a real estate agent． He got rich by selling worthless farmland to people from the city who didn't know what they were buying． He was very good at fooling the public． Mr． Fix used the money he got from selling farmland to buy an old apartment building in the city． Most of the people who lived in the building had low incomes and were used to paying low rents． Mr． Fix wanted to make a few minor improvements and then charge high rents， but first he had to get rid of the old tenants． He chose to do this by making life miserable for everyone in the building． He drew up a long list of unnecessary rules and insisted that everyone obey them． Anyone who broke the rules had to move out of the building．
    Mr． Fix was capable of doing anything to get money． At times he even cut off the electricity and said he was saving energy． 
    The tenants complained but it was no use． Mr． Fix always told the tenants to leave if they weren't happy． After a while they got tired of living under these conditions and started moving out． Mr． Fix almost succeeded in driving everyone out of the building， but he didn't count on the opposition he got from one of his tenants， an old lady named Olive Grove． She wouldn't give up without a fight and even went to tell the story to the newspaper．

金钱万能 
本&#8226;菲克斯过去是一个房地产经纪人。他通过将无任何价值的农田卖给那些不知实情的城市人而发财。他很善于愚弄大众。菲克斯先生用出售农田赚的钱买了一幢城里的旧公寓。住在公寓里的人大都收入很低，而且习惯于交低租金。菲克斯先生想做些细微的改进，然后收取高租金，但首先他必须赶走旧房客。他决定通过把房客的生活弄的过不下去的办法来达到目的。他制定了许多不必要的规定，而且坚决要求每个人都要遵守。违反了规定的人必须搬出公寓。 
任何赚钱的事菲克斯先生都会去做。有时他甚至断电，说自己是在节约能源。房客们的抱怨都无济于事。菲克斯先生告诉他们，如果不高兴就搬走好了。过了一段时间，房客们厌倦了这样的生活，开始搬出。菲克斯先生几乎成功地赶走了公寓里的所有人，但他没有预料到他会遭到其中的一位房客，名叫奥利夫&#8226;格罗夫的老太太的抵制。她不想就此束手就擒，于是她就向报纸投诉。


Lesson66 Running
    Your heart is pumping as fast as your feet are moving． You take great strides， building up speed， until you reach a good steady pace． Your sneakers are hitting the pavement over and over and the breeze is blowing in your face．
Running is an awesome way to enjoy the outdoors， build muscles， lose weight， and stay healthy． It's also a very important part of most other sports． So if you want to play football， basketball， or anything that requires speed， endurance， or general fitness， running will help you．
    Running is often associated with a track team， but most people who run do it on their own． One of the coolest things about running is that there's always a style to match your interests， abilities， and attitudes． You can run at any speed， for any distance， or with as many or as few people as you like． Many teenagers find running an excellent way of keeping fit and strong． Let's listen to what they say about running． 
     “Running helps me stay relaxed． I enjoy racing and giving it all I've got．” “I started running 2 years ago with my sisters． 
    I try to run at least 2 miles a day．” “My favourite thing to do is distance running mainly because it's a challenge． I like to push myself to the limit and see how far I can go．” “I like to run because the kids at school make fun of me and running is my escape． It releases the stress from the school day． ”

跑步 
你的心脏随着脚步的移动以同样的速度跳动。你大步行走，慢慢加速，直到步伐稳定。你的运动鞋反复拍打着人行道，微风吹拂在你的脸上。 
跑步是一种享受户外、锻炼肌肉、减肥、保持健康的好办法。跑步也是其他大多数运动的重要组成部分。所以，如果你想踢足球，打篮球，或者其他对速度、耐力或整体健康有要求的运动，跑步对你很有帮助。 
跑步经常与田径队联系在一起，但大多数跑步的人是独自练习的。跑步最酷的地方就是总有一种跑步方式符合你的兴趣、能力和态度。你可以以任何速度，跑任何距离，和很多或者很少的人一起跑，只要你喜欢。许多青少年发现跑步是保持健康和强健的很好的方法。让我们听听他们是怎么说的吧。“跑步让我放松。我喜欢跑步并尽可能地练习。”“我两年前和姐姐一起开始跑步。我每天至少跑两英里。”“我最喜欢做的事就是长跑，因为它具有挑战性。我喜欢把我自己推向极限，看自己可以跑多远。”“我喜欢跑步因为学校里的孩子总是取笑我，跑步可以使我避开他们，它让我释放在学校里的压力。”


Lesson67 Bill Gates
    Most high school students would be delighted to be accepted by Harvard University， but Harvard had little to offer to young Bill Gates． After several semesters， he dropped out and went to work． Finally he made himself the richest man in the world．
    Actually， his career started in high school where he discovered the amazing world of computers． He quickly learned the programming language called BASIC． He spent hours finding out what a computer could do． Before long， he and Paul Allen， a classmate， became local experts on computer programming．
    After they graduated from high school， the friends went separate ways． Allen stayed in Seattle and Gates went to Boston to attend Harvard． At Harvard， however， Gates was not a serious student． He spent most of his time in the university computer centre．
    The two young men decided to form a small company in 1975． 
    They called it Microsoft． They let the computer company license their operating system for $30 per computer． In their first year， they earned $16，000． This was enough to convince Gates to quit Harvard and work full-time．
    Microsoft became a public company in 1981． The company grew quickly and Gates became very rich． Gates may have slowed down a little， but he still works hard to stay ahead of computer hardware， creating operating systems for computers that are not yet in the stores．

比尔&#8226;盖茨 
若能被哈佛录取，大部分的高中学生都会很高兴，但是哈佛却没有给小比尔&#8226;盖茨多少。几个学期后，他辍学了，出去工作。最终他使自己成为了世界上最富裕的人。
事实上，他的事业从高中时就开始了，那时他发现了令人着迷的电脑世界。他很快学会了叫做BASIC的编程语言。他花费很多时间去探究计算机能做些什么。不久以后，他和他的一个同班同学保罗&#8226;爱伦就开始成为当地电脑编程的专家。
高中毕业后，这对朋友走上了不同的道路。爱伦呆在西雅图而盖茨去了波士顿读哈佛。然而在哈佛，盖茨并不是一个认真的学生。他将绝大多数的时间花在了学校计算机中心里。 
1975年这两个年轻人决定开一个小公司。他们将它叫做微软。他们以每台计算机30美元的价格向电脑厂商授权他们的操作系统。第一年他们赚了16 000美元。这足以说服盖茨放弃哈佛的学业去开始全职工作。 
1981年微软成为了一家上市公司。公司发展很快，盖茨变的非常富有。盖茨可能已经放慢了脚步，但他仍努力工作以保持领先于电脑硬件的发展，开发市场上还没有的电脑操作系统。


Lesson68 Who's the Offender?
    Three young men were playing with a gun in a street in a quiet area of the town after dark when one of them fired it by mistake without aiming it at anything． The bullet broke a window in an old lady's house．
    The young men made off at once when they saw the damage they had done， but the old lady looked out of a window when she heard the explosion and she recognized one of them as the son of a man and woman who lived not far from her．
    The old lady complained to the police， and a detective went to the young man's house and found the gun， so he took the young man and his friends to the police station．
    There his chief officer questioned the young men to find out which of them owned the gun， but none of them was willing to admit because they did not have a license for owning a gun．
    At last the chief officer decided to put an end to the conversation． He turned to the detective and demanded to know whether he had got an officer's permission to take the gun away from the young man who owned it． “No， sir，” he answered nervously， “I didn't get it．”
     “In that case，” the officer declared angrily， “you were quite wrong to take it away from him． You'd better return it immediately or there'll be trouble!”This made the young men smile happily at each other， and as soon as the detective held the gun out and said “Here you are，” one of them put his hand out in order to get it back．That is how the officer finally discovered whom the gun belonged to．

offender 罪犯   aim 瞄准    bullet ? 子弹   explosion 爆炸，爆裂

谁做的坏事？
天黑后，在安静的城镇街道上，三个年轻人在玩枪，这时，其中一个人没有瞄准，误发了一枪。子弹打碎了一个老太太房间的玻璃窗。 
当年轻人看到他们打破了窗玻璃时，马上就逃跑了，但是老太太听到破裂声后就朝窗外看，她认出其中一个年轻人是住在不远处的一对夫妻的儿子。
老太太向警察投诉了，一个侦探到那年轻人家里，发现了枪，他将这个年轻人和他的朋友带到了警察局。
在那里，侦探的长官审问三个年轻人，希望找出是谁拥有这支枪，但是他们没有一个人愿意承认因为他们都没有拥有枪支的许可证。
最后，长官决定结束谈话。他转向侦探，追问他是否得到官方允许拿走那个拥有枪支的年轻人的枪。“没有，长官，”侦探紧张地回答，“我没有得到允许。”
“这样的话，”长官生气地说，“你拿走那个年轻人的枪是不对的。你最好立即把枪还给他，否则你将会有麻烦。”
年轻人们一听非常高兴地看着对方。当侦探刚把枪递过去说“给你”时，其中一个年轻人就伸出手想把枪拿回去。
这样，长官就最终发现了这支枪是属于谁的。


Lesson69 The Spending Safari
    Drake was excited because he and his family finally decided to go to Park Safari， a wild animal park a few hours from his house． Drake's parents agreed to pay the admission price as long as he would pay for the extras like rides， food， and souvenirs with money he had saved from his allowance．
    While he enjoyed many games in the park， he couldn't help spending his savings on the things he liked． Drake bought lots of souvenirs because he wanted things that would help him remember that cool day． He bought a t-shirt， a poster， a stuffed Cheetah， and a water bottle． He even bought a huge stack of postcards， even though his mother explained that they had taken lots of photos． After he paid for everything， he had less than $5．00 left， and he had had over $50．00 at the start of the day!
    A few weeks later Drake had a lot of great memories of Park Safari． He liked his mom's photos a lot more than the postcards he bought because they were more personal． As for the souvenirs that he wanted so badly? Most were just taking up space in his room， and he wasn't able to remember why he wanted them so much． The worst part was， he was at the mall the other day and saw an awesome skateboard with a tiger painted on it． It cost $40．00， but since he spent all his money on little things at Park Safari， he couldn't afford it．

开销巨大的旅行 
德雷克感到非常激动，因为他们全家终于决定去野生动物园旅行了。这座野生公园，离他家有几小时的路程。德雷克的父母答应支付门票的钱，只要德雷克支付其他例如骑马、食物、纪念品的费用，这些费用要从德雷克的积蓄中出。 
公园里，德雷克玩了许多有趣的游戏，他情不自禁地把他的积蓄花在了他喜欢的东西上。德雷克买了许多纪念品，因为他觉得这些东西可以帮他回忆起这高兴的一天。他买了T恤衫、海报、一只填充的印度豹和一个水瓶。尽管母亲说他们已经拍了许多照片，他还是买了一大堆明信片。当他买好了所有东西后，他只剩下不到五美元，而早上一开始时他有五十多美元。 
几星期后，德雷克仍保有许多关于野生动物园的美好回忆。比起明信片，他更喜欢母亲的照片，因为它们更加个性化。至于那些他非常想要的纪念品呢？大部分只是占据了他房间的空间，他已经记不起来为什么那时这么想要它们了。最糟糕的是，一天他去商场看到了一块很棒的滑板，板上画着一只老虎。滑板要四十美元，但是因为他把所有的钱都花在野生动物园里那些小东西上了，他买不起滑板了。


Lesson70 Rumour and Gossip
    You hear a juicy story from a friend， who heard it from another friend， who heard it from a person in the hall， who read it on a note passed in math class， which was written by somebody who probably just made it up．
    Chances are， rumours and gossip are always floating around your school or community． That's totally normal． After all， everyone gossips...even parents， celebrities， and politicians． It's part of how we communicate and stay connected with other people's lives． But what is the difference between a rumour and gossip?
    A rumour is a piece of information or a story that has not been verified， meaning that the person telling it doesn't know if it's true or false． It might be true， it might be partially true and partially made up， or it might be totally made up．
    Gossip， on the other hand， is a little different． Gossip is talk that is somehow “juicy，” meaning it deals with subjects that are shocking or personal． Gossip is usually about things like love and relationships， or private things that people don't talk openly about． When a piece of gossip is known to be false， it's a lie， plain and simple． If a piece of gossip about somebody is true， it can still be very hurtful because that information may be private and personal．
    Sometimes， rumours and gossip are harmless， but at other times they can be very hurtful to individuals， friendships， and whole groups of people． Did you know that spreading rumours and gossip about someone is a form of bullying? Yes．

juicy ? 有趣的   rumour ? 流言   gossip ? 闲话   connect ? 连接
verify ? 证实     partially ? 部分地   shocking ? 骇人听闻的

流言和闲话 
你从一个朋友那里听说了一个有趣的故事，你的朋友是从另一个朋友那里听说的，你朋友的朋友又是从大厅里的一个人那里听说的，大厅里的那人是从数学课上传来的一张纸条上知道了这件事，纸条可能是某个人刚编造出来的。 
流言和闲话很有可能充满着你的学校或社区。这是非常正常的。毕竟，每个人都会扯闲话，甚至是父母、名人、政治家。它是我们与他人交流、与他人生活保持联系的一部分。但是流言和闲话有什么区别呢？
流言是一条未经证实的消息或故事，也就是说，说这条消息或故事的人不知道它是真是假。它可能是真的，也有可能部分是真的部分是编造的，或者完全是编造的。
而闲话就有些不同了。闲话是一些“有趣”的谈话，也就是说，它涉及骇人听闻或私人的话题。闲话经常谈论一些诸如爱情、关系的事或人们不在公众场合谈论的隐私。当一条闲话被证实是假的，很简单，这就是谎言。如果有关某人的一条闲话是真的，那它仍旧会伤害到别人因为这些信息是私人的、隐秘的。 
有时候，流言和闲话是无害的，但是有时候它们可能对个人、友情和整个一群人造成伤害。你知道吗？散布流言闲话其实就是欺负当事人。

Lesson1 Hobbies 
     “Hobbies” are a great British and American tradition. A “ hobby' ” is a special interest or activity that you do in your time off. 
    Some people have animals as hobbies. They keep rabbits, or go fishing. They train dogs to do tricks, or keep pigeons to race and carry messages. Some are crazy about plants. They try to grow cacti or rare tropical flowers in their kitchens and sitting rooms. 
    Others are mad about their car or their motorbike. They spend their Saturdays and Sundays washing them, painting them, or buying new bits and pieces to make them go even faster. 
Children and teenagers are great collectors. They collect stamps, or postcards, or matchboxes, or pictures of a favorite footballer or pop star. 
    Many people make things as a hobby. Some teach themselves at home, but a lot of people go to evening classes at their local college. Just look under letter B in a list of London or New York evening classes and you'll find: Ballet, Batik, Bengali dance, Body building, Bread-making and Byzantine history. Not everyone goes to evening classes to learn about his or her special interest. These people can read books or just learn on their own. 

cacti [ 植 ] 仙人掌 (cactus 的复数形式 )    batik 蜡染 
Bengali dance 孟加拉舞    Byzantine history 拜占庭历史 

业余爱好 
“业余爱好”是英国和美国的一项伟大传统。“业余爱好”是指你在空闲时从事的一项特别兴趣爱好或活动。 
有些人的业余爱好是养动物。他们养兔子或者去钓鱼。他们训练狗耍把戏，或者养鸽子参加比赛和传送信息。有些人特别喜欢植物。他们在厨房和客厅里种上仙人掌或者稀有的热带花草。 
还有的人很喜欢汽车或摩托车。他们在周六和周日洗车、上油漆或者购买新零件使车跑得更快。 
小孩和青少年酷爱收集。他们收集邮票、明信片、火柴盒，或者喜爱的足球运动员或当红明星的图片。 
很多人的业余爱好是自制物品。一部分人在家自学，但很多人到当地大学上夜校。浏览一下伦敦或纽约以 B 
开头的夜校课程，你会找到：芭蕾舞、蜡染、孟加拉舞、健身、做面包和拜占庭历史。有些人并不是去夜校学习自己特殊爱好的，他们看书学习或完全靠自己琢磨。


Lesson2 Heads of State
    In America , the President is the Head of the States. He makes the most important decisions and chooses the members of his cabinet who will help him govern the country. 
    The President also represents the United States on official occasions. He receives ambassadors from other countries, gives parties for important visitors from abroad, and takes the first place in any national ceremony. Americans are always interested in the President's wife and children — the “first lady” and the “first family”. They expect their Presidents to have a good family life and to be an example to the country. 
    In Britain , the Queen is the head of State. She represents Britain (and the Commonwealth). She travels about the UK , meeting people, visiting schools and hospitals, and going to important local events. She and her husband, and other members of her family, also travel abroad as rather special ambassadors to other countries. 
    British people enjoy their “royals”. They like reading about them in newspapers, and seeing them on TV. To some they are like film stars, interesting just because they are famous. 
    Most people feel that the Queen is a symbol of Britain 's long history and national traditions. 

Ambassador 大使    ceremony 典礼，仪式 

国家元首 
在美国，总统是国家元首，他决定最重要的事情并挑选能帮其治理国家的内阁成员。 
美国总统也是在官方场合代表美国的人。他接见外国大使，为国外重要访客举行宴会，并主持所有国家典礼。美国人一贯对总统的妻子和孩子感兴趣——“第一夫人”和“第一家庭”。他们期望他们的总统家庭幸福，为全国树立榜样。 
女王是英国的国家元首。她代表英国（和英联邦）。她走遍英国的每一个角落，会见民众、参观学校和医院，视察发生重大事件的地区。女王和她的丈夫，以及女王家庭的其他成员，也作为特殊的使者出访其他国家。 
英国人喜欢他们的“王室成员”。他们喜欢阅读有关王室成员的新闻，看到他们在电视上露面。对他们来说，王室成员就像电影明星，因为有名而吸引人。人们大多觉得女王是英国悠久历史和国家传统的象征。


Lesson3 Clothes

    These dayes most people in Britain and the USA do not wear very former clothes, but sometimes it is important to wear right thing. Many British people don't think about clothes very much. They just like to be comfortable. When they go out to enjoy themselvies they can wear almost anything. At theaters, movie houses and concerts you can put on what you like, from elegant suits and dresses to jeans and sweaters. 
    Anything goes as long as you look clean and tidy. However, In Britain as well as the USA, man and officers usually wear suits and ties and woman wear dresses and skirts,jackets and small trousers. Docotors,lawyers and business people wear quite former clothes. It's different to say exactly what people wear in Britain and the United State because everyone is different.If you are not sure what to wear, watch what other people do and then do the same or ask the advice of your friend or your host. You feel more relaxed if you don't look too different from anyone else.

这些天很多英国人和美国人都没有穿以前的衣服，但是有时穿合适的服装是很重要的！很多英国
人不太在意穿着。只要穿着舒服就可以了。当他们出去玩时穿什么都可以。在剧院，电影院和音
乐厅，从优雅的外套和裙子到牛仔和羊毛衫，只要你喜欢穿什么都可以。
任何衣服都会穿的很长，只要你穿着干净得体。然而，在英国和美国，男人和办公人员通常穿
外套打领带，女士穿女装和裙子，夹克和小裤子。医生，律师和商业人员穿以前的衣服。很难具
体的说在英国和美国人们都穿什么因为每个人都不一样。
如果你不确定穿什么，看看其他人怎么穿然后照他们的穿或者问问你朋友或家里人的意见。如
果你看上去和别人穿着一样你会感觉越放松。


Lesson4 This Is Britain
    "Great Britain" has several different names, "Britain", "United Kingdom", or just the "UK". There are four different countries in the United Kingdom: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
    Everyone from Britain is British, but only people from England are English. People from Scotland are Scottish, people from Wales are Welsh, and people from Northern Ireland are Irish. Don't call a Scottish or Welsh person English. He won't like it!Altogether more than 56 million people live in Britain, in big cities like London, Liverpool and Manchester, and in the open country with lovely hills and woods, quiet rivers, lakes and farmlands.Everyone in Britain speaks English, but in some parts of Scotland and Wales people speak their dialects as well. The Welsh are required by the government to learn Welsh, and you can see road signs in Welsh all over Wales.
    Everyone speaks English, but they do not all speak it in the same way. A Scottish person has to listen carefully if he wants to understand a Londoner and when a Welsh person speaks, everyone knows at once where he comes from!
    Many people think that the weather is cold and wet in Britain all year round, but it isn't! True, it sometimes rains and even snows for days and days, but every year there are weeks of beautiful sunny weather when the British go out to sunbathe in their bikinis.

dialect 方言   sunbathe 日光浴   bikini 比基尼，三点式女泳装

这就是英国 
“英国”有几个不同的称呼：“不列颠”、“联合王国”或“UK”。大不列颠联合王国由英格兰、苏格兰、威尔士和北爱尔兰四个地区组成。 
所有大不列颠人都是英国人，但只有来自英格兰的人是英格兰人，来自苏格兰的是苏格兰人，来自威尔士的是威尔士人，来自北爱尔兰的是爱尔兰人。不要称苏格兰人或威尔士人为英格兰人，他们不喜欢。 
英国总人口五千六百多万。大城市有伦敦，利物浦，曼彻斯特。在广袤无垠的乡村，可见秀丽的山峦和树林、静静流淌的河流、湖泊和农场。
英语是英国的通用语言，但在苏格兰和威尔士的一些地方，人们也讲自己的方言。威尔士政府要求威尔士人学习威尔士语，在威尔士全境可见使用威尔士语的交通标识。
人人都会说英语，但讲出来的方式不一样。苏格兰人要非常认真，才能听懂伦敦人讲的英语。威尔士人一开口讲英语，大家就知道他是哪里人了。 
很多人认为英国的天气一年到头都是阴冷潮湿的，但事实不是这样。的确，有时会连续数日地下雨，甚至下雪，但每年都会有阳光灿烂的几周，这时候英国人就会穿着比基尼出来晒太阳。


Lesson5 A Lawn That Takes a Long Time To Make
    Mr. Anderson lives in America, and last year he came to England to visit his father's hometown.There was a big garden in the town with green grass in the centre. A gardener was watering it, and Mr. Anderson said to him, "Good morning. Is this your garden?""No," answered the gardener, "it isn't mine, but I work here.""How do people get such a beautiful lawn?' Mr. Anderson asked."Ours are never as good as this.'The gardener stopped his work and looked at Mr. Anderson. Then he said, "You are from America, aren't you?"Mr. Anderson answered, "Yes, but my father came from here.""Well,"the gardener said, "it's easy to grow lawns like this. Let me tell you how."Mr. Anderson went into the garden. 'My name's Anderson,' he said to the gardener, "What's yours?""My name's Gray," the gardener answered, "Now about the lawns. First we sow our seeds; then when the grass appears, we pull all the weeds out; after that, we cut the grass every week. We water it every day when the weather is very dry.""Oh," Mr. Anderson answered, "that's very interesting, Gray, and how long does it take before the lawn ends up like this? The gardener thought for a few moments and then answered, 'Oh, about four hundred years."

lawn 草坪   sow 播种

历时弥久长成的草坪
安德森先生住在美国，去年他到英国参观他父亲的家乡。
镇上有个大公园，中间是绿草地。
一个园丁正在浇水，安德森先生对他说：“早上好。这是你的花园吗？”
“不是，”园丁答道，“不是我的，不过我在这里工作。”
“怎么才能有这么漂亮的草地呢？”安德森问，“我们从没有这么好的草坪。”
园丁停下手中的活，看着安德森先生问：“你是美国人，对吗？”
安德森先生回答：“是的，不过我父亲原是英国人。”
“哦，”园丁说：“种一块这样的草地很容易，我现在就告诉你。”
安德森先生走进公园。“我叫安德森。”，他问园丁，“你叫什么？”
“格雷，”园丁说，“现在来说说草坪。首先我们播种，然后等小草长出来后，除掉野草，之后每周都修剪。天气干燥的时候每天都浇水。”
“噢，”安德森先生回道，“真有意思，格雷，不过长成一块像这样的草地要多长时间呀？”园丁想了一会，之后说：“呃，大约四百年。”


Lesson6 Schools
    In America, all children from six to sixteen go to school. 
    They spend six years in 'elementary' school, and four or six years in 'secondary or 'high' school. School education is free. At the end of every school year, the child takes a test. 
    If he does well, he goes into the next grade. If he doesn't do well, he has to repeat the grade. Some schools have modern teaching equipment, like computers and closed circuit television, but there are also small country schools, with just one classroom. At the end of their time at school, most students get a high school diploma. If they want to go on to college, they take college admission tests.
    In Britain, all children from five to sixteen go to school. They spend six years in 'primary' school, and then go on to 'secondary' school. In Britain there are 'state' schools, which are free, and private schools for which parents pay. 
    Many British private schools are 'boarding' schools. The children stay at school all the time, and only come home in the holidays. They usually wear uniforms at all schools.
    Teaching in both countries is usually quite informal. Students often work together in groups, and go to the teacher only when they need help.

closed circuit television 闭路电视   diploma 文凭，毕业证书   boarding school 寄宿学校

学校 
在美国，六岁到十六岁的孩子在学校读书。他们读六年小学，四年或六年中学。中小学教育是免费的。每学年末，学生要参加考试。如果他顺利通过，就可升级，否则必须留级。有些学校有现代化的教学设备，像计算机和闭路电视，但也有小的只有一间教室的乡村学校。完成中学学业后，大多数学生会拿到中学毕业证书。如果想读大学，他们还需参加大学入学考试。 
在英国，五岁到十六岁的小孩都要上学。他们读六年小学，然后读中学。英国有免费的“公立学校”，也有需要父母付费的私立学校。英国的很多私立学校是寄宿制学校，学生除在节假日回家外，其他时间都呆在学校里。所有学校的学生通常都要穿校服。
英美两国的教学大都很随意。学生通常组成小组学习，只在需要帮助时才会去找老师。


Lesson7 Universities
    Nearly half of all Americans go on to college when they graduate from high schools. Some colleges are small, with only a few hundred students, but some of the big state universities are huge, with up to 60,000 students. There are more than 2,600 universities in the USA, and nearly all colleges have both men and women students.
    You can study many interesting subjects at college, in short or long courses, but if you want to get a degree, you have to study for at least four years. Classes start in September and go on to early June with a break in the middle.
    In Britain, you can get a degree at university, or in some of the many colleges of further education. There are 42 universities in Britain. There are also many colleges in Britain that teach English as a foreign language. Some have short courses (a few weeks or months), and some have one- or two-year courses.
    University classes start in September and go on until mid-June with two breaks, one at Christmas, and one at Easter. Most degrees take three years, but some take four.

大学 
接近一半的美国中学毕业生到大学继续求学。一些小的学院仅有几百个学生，但一些大的州立大学着实很大，学生多达六万。美国有两千六百多所大学，且几乎所有大学男女生兼收。 
在大学你能学习很多有意思的课程，时间可长可短，但如果你想拿学位的话，至少要花四年时间。大学九月开学，持续到下年六月初，中间有一段假期。
在英国，你可从大学或为数众多的继续教育学院获得学位。英国有四十二所大学。有许多大学把英语作为一门外语教授。有些大学有短期课程（几星期或几个月），另有一些大学有一到两年的课程。
大学从九月到次年六月中旬授课，圣诞节和复活节放假。大多数学位要求三年学习时间，有些要求四年。


Lesson8 School Life at College
    Three months have passed since I entered university. I belong to the tennis club, which is great for my health. In the club I have made a lot of friends but, sad to say, I don't have a girlfriend yet.
    I am very busy with lessons this first semester. English is a required subject, so I have to get at least a pass. I had a good shot at the questions on the English exam yesterday. I probably scored at least 80 points. However busy I may be with my part-time job and other pastimes, I attend my language classes as often as possible, because if I am absent from more than one-third of the classes, I cannot get the credits whatever the reason may be. I spent much time preparing for Chinese, but the lesson was cancelled today!
    Tomorrow is the deadline for my physics paper which took me three days to write. I hope to major in science education in the future.

shot 尝试；努力

大学校园生活
升入大学已经三个月了。我加入了网球俱乐部，这对健康大有好处。在俱乐部里，我交了很多朋友，遗憾的是，还没有交到女朋友。
第一个学期，我要忙于上课。英语是必修课，所以最起码我要通过这门课的考试，在昨天的英语考试中，发挥得还不错，最少也能得八十分。不管我多么忙于兼职工作和其他消遣，我还是尽可能多上语言课，因为如果缺课三分之一以上，不管有什么理由都不能拿到学分。我花了很长时间学习中文，不过今天这门课被取消了！
明天是提交物理课论文的最后期限，我花了三天的时间来写这篇论文。希望在将来我能够主修科学教育。


Lesson9 Oxford
    What is so special about Oxford and Cambridge, the two oldest universities in England? Why do so many students want to study there?
    Both of these university towns are very beautiful. They have some of the finest architecture in Britain. Some of their colleges, chapels and libraries are three, four or even up to seven hundred years old, and are full of valuable books and precious paintings. Both towns have many lovely gardens, where the students can read and relax in the summer months.
Oxford is the older university of the two. The first of its colleges was founded in 1249. The university now has thirty-four colleges and about twelve thousand students, many of them from other countries. There were no women students at Oxford until 1878, when the first women's college, Lady Margaret Hall, opened. Now, women study at all colleges but one for Monks in training.
    Oxford is, of course, famous for its first class education as well as its beautiful buildings. It boasts a quiet atmosphere, friendly colleagues, and the four-hundred-year-old Bodleian library, which has over five million books.
It is not easy to get a place at Oxford University to study for a degree, but outside the university there are many smaller private colleges which offer less difficult courses and where it is easy to enrol. Most students in these private schools take business, secretarial or English language courses.

牛津大学
英国最古老的两所大学——牛津大学和剑桥大学有什么独特的魅力呢？为什么这么多学生希望到牛津和剑桥来学习？ 
这两座大学城都十分漂亮。这里有一些全英国最精美的建筑，一些学院、教堂和图书馆始建于三四百年甚至七百年前，里面藏有珍贵的图书和绘画。这两座大学城都有许多美丽的花园，学子们在夏日里可以在这里读书和休闲。 
牛津的历史比剑桥更悠久，其最早的学院始建于1249年。牛津现有三十四个学院，有大约一万两千学生，其中有许多是留学生。1878年第一个女子学院——玛格丽特&#8226;霍尔学院成立，在这之前，牛津是没有女学生的。而现在除了一个僧侣学院外其他所有的学院都招收女学生。 
当然令牛津闻名于世的不仅是其精美的建筑物，还有其一流的教学。这里有优雅的环境，友好的同事，以及一个有着四百年历史、藏书五百多万册的牛津大学博德利图书馆。 
要得到在牛津大学学习和获得学位的机会是很难的。但是在牛津大学的外围有许多小一点的私立学院，那里的课程要容易一点，入学的难度也不大。这些私立学院的学生大多在修商务、文秘和英语等课程。


Lesson10 A Student's Guide to Exam Stress
    As exam fever heats up, keep your cool with tips from our health correspondent Dr Barry Lynch.
    Stress is difficult to define but most of us know it when we experience it. We may have mental symptoms: panic, feeling trapped or overwhelmed. Or there may be physical symptoms: sweating palms, butterflies, headaches, breathlessness or sleeplessness.
    Stress can cause us to feel overwhelmed and powerless to tackle the very things that are causing the stress in the first place. So make a carefully written plan and the problems will seem less overwhelming. Ticking off each thing as you do it will help you feel there is light at the end of the tunnel.
    When you're writing your revision plan, make sure you include some time off — exactly an hour or whatever — before you go back to work. Look forward to your time off and do something pleasant in it. Work out little treats and rewards for yourself as you tick off each thing on your plan. The treats can be simple: an ice cream, half an hour listening to your personal stereo, or walking the dog.
    Easier said than done, I know, but exercise is one of the best ways of relaxing: it's the natural way to deal with adrenaline and similar hormones that are rushing around your body. A walk will help; a quick swim or half an hour of tennis or another game is even better.
    Don't drink endless cups of tea or coffee: although caffeine is a stimulant it will eventually only make you tenser and nervous.
    Don't try to go without sleep — sleep is a natural way of relieving stress.
    Don't be tempted to use alcohol or other drugs to relieve stress. They create more problems than they solve.

学生如何缓解考试压力
当考试的热潮一浪高过一浪时，你必须保持冷静，下面就听听我们的健康记者巴里&#8226;林奇博士的建议吧。 
压力很难定义，但是当我们遇到压力时就知道了什么叫压力。我们可能会有精神上的症状：惊慌，感到无助或不知所措。或许还有生理上的症状：手出汗，胃不舒服，头痛，喘不过气来或失眠。
压力能使我们感到不安和无力处理那些最初导致压力产生的事情。所以制定一份详细的书面计划可以使麻烦易于解决。每做完一件事后你就勾掉它，这样，你就会感到希望就在前头。 
当你制定计划时，千万留出一些休息时间——在你重新回去工作前——要有一小时左右的时间。盼望着休息时间快来，到时候做些令人愉快的事情。当你在计划上勾掉一件事时，就给自己一点小小的奖赏。奖赏可以非常简单：一个冰激凌，听半小时音乐或溜溜狗。
我知道说起来容易做起来难，其实运动是最好的放松方法之一：它能很自然地消除由于紧张不安而导致的内分泌激增。 
散步就有所帮助，快速游泳或打半小时的网球或其他运动将更有好处。
不要不停地喝茶或咖啡：虽然咖啡因有刺激作用，但它最终只会让你越来越紧张不安。
不要熬夜——睡眠是减轻压力的自然方法。
不要为了减轻压力而经受不住酒精或其他药品的诱惑。它们制造的麻烦会比它们解决的问题更多。


Lesson11 A Daughter
    Sally was nineteen years old. She had always lived with her parents, but now the time had come for her to go to university in another part of the country. Her mother was a little sad and also afraid because she loved her daughter very much, and she thought, "My little girl will be alone for the first time in her life. She won't know anybody. There will be nobody to look after her, and perhaps she'll have trouble, or will feel low and we won't be there to help her."
    Sally said goodbye to her father and to her cat, and promised to telephone every week.
    Then every week Sally kept her promise and telephoned. Sally was always very happy and never said that she missed her parents.
    Then holidays were getting near. That week, when Sally telephoned her parents, she said, "My friends all said that they were very happy to return home again soon."
    Sally's mother was very glad. "She must really miss us,' she thought. Then she said, "Did you say that too?"
    "Oh,yes!" Sally answered."We all agreed that it's easy to speak to our parents on the telephone every week when we're away, but we really miss our pets!"

女儿
萨利十九岁，她一直和父母住在一起，但她现在要去国内另一个地方上大学了。她的母亲有点难过，也很担心，因为她非常爱自己的女儿，她想，“这将是我的小女第一次独自一人生活，她不认识其他人，没有人来照顾她，而且她可能会遇到麻烦，或情绪低落，而我们不能在那里帮助她。”
萨利向父亲和她的猫道了别，并且答应每周打电话。
之后，萨利每周依约打电话。她总是很快乐，而且从不说她想念父母。
假期临近了。这一周，当萨利给父母打电话说：“我的朋友都说很高兴马上就回家了。”
萨利的母亲颇为高兴。“她准是非常想我们，”她想。然后她问：“你也这么说了吗？” 
“噢，是的！”萨利答：“我们都认为和父母在电话里要比在家时面对面地讲话容易得多，可是我们真的很想念我们的宠物！”



Lesson12 The Government of the United Kingdom
    The British method of government has developed very slowly over hundreds of years. This is perhaps why it can be rather difficult to understand. For example, the Queen is the head of State, but she has no real power.
    Parliament is the real government of Britain. It has two 'Houses', the House of Lords, and the House of Commons. The 'Lords' are members of the old aristocracy, bishops, lawyers, and retired politicians. They have little power now, but they can suggest new laws and change or delay laws that the House of Commons wants to pass. The House of Commons makes laws, agrees on policy, and decides what taxes the people must pay. 
    The British people choose the 650 members of the House of Commons every five years. In each area there are usually two or three main political parties to choose from. The party who gets most members into parliament makes the new government.
The Prime Minister is the leader of the winning party. Only party members (not the whole British people) choose their leader. The Prime Minister chooses the members of the Cabinet, who are called ministers. Each minister has a special job to do, for example, education, or health, or transport.

parliament 国会，议会   House of Lords （英国国会的）上议院
bishop 主教   cabinet 政府内阁

英国的政体
英国的政体几百年间发展缓慢，这恐怕也是人们很难弄明白它的原因。例如，女王是国家首脑，但她没有实权。
议会是英国真正的管理机关，它分为上议院和下议院两院。上议院议员是由旧贵族、主教、律师以及退休的政治家组成。他们拥有的权力不多，但可以提议新法，改变或推迟下议院想要通过的法律。下议院制定法律、协商政策，并决定税收种类。英国人每五年选出下议院的六百五十名议员。在每个选举区，通常有两个或三个主要政党参选。在议会获得最多席位的政党组成新政府。
获胜政党的领导人成为首相。只有政党成员（而不是全体英国人）选举他们的领导者。首相挑选内阁成员，这些人称为大臣。每个大臣有特定的负责范围，如教育、健康、交通。


Lesson13 A Piece of Meat
    Joe Biggs was a butcher. His shop was in a village in one of the most beautiful parts of the south of England, and he worked in it for many years while his father was there. Then, his father stopped working in the shop, and Joe had to work harder.
    One Thursday a woman came into the shop five minutes before closing. "I'm sorry I'm late," she said, "but some people have just phoned me to say that they are going to come to dinner tonight, and I need some more meat."
Joe only had one piece of good meat in the shop. He had sold all the others earlier in the day. He took the piece out and told the woman it is ￡6.50.
    "That piece is too small,"the woman answered. "Haven't you got anything bigger?"
    Joe went into the room behind his shop, opened the refrigerator, put the piece of meat into it. After a while he took it out again and shut the door of the refrigerator with a lot of noise. Then he brought the piece of meat back to the woman and said, "This piece is bigger and more expensive. It's ￡8.75."
"Good," the woman answered with a smile. "Give me both of them, please."

一块肉 
乔&#8226;比格斯是个肉店老板。他的店在最美丽的英国南部的一个村庄里。他父亲在店里工作时，他已经在那里干了很多年。后来，乔的父亲不在店里做事了，乔就干得更辛苦了。 
有天星期四，一位女士在关门前五分钟来到店里。“很抱歉，这么晚我才来，”她说，“但有人刚刚打电话告诉我他们今晚过来吃晚饭，所以我得再买些肉。”
乔的店里只剩下一块好肉，其他的早些时候已经卖完了。乔拿出这块肉，告诉女士应付六个半英镑。
“那块太小了，”女士说，“你没有更大些的吗？”
乔走进店后的房间，打开冰箱，把手中的肉放进去一会。过来一会，他将它拿出来，并使劲关上冰箱门，发出很大响声。他把那块肉拿给女士，说：“这块大一些，也贵一些，要八点七五英镑。”
“好的，”女士笑着回答，“请把两块肉都给我吧。”


Lesson14 The Government of the United States
    Washington, Lincoln, Eisenhower, Kennedy — some of the great names of American history, the names of her presidents.
    These days, the American President is one of the most powerful men in the world. He can make war, or peace. He can touch the lives of millions in many different countries, but the President cannot do just what he wants. The Congress must agree first.
    In some ways, the United States is like fifty small countries and not one large one. Every state has its own governor, its own police, and its own laws. For example, in some states you can buy an alcoholic drink when you are 18. In others, you must wait until you are 21.
    The government of the whole country (the 'federal' government) works from Washington, the capital city. This is where Congress is based. Congress has two parts, the Senate, and the House of Representatives. There are 100 members of the Senate (called Senators), two from each state. The President cannot act without the Senate's agreement. The House of Representatives has 435 members. Like the senators, they can make new laws.
    Americans choose a new President every four years. The election is a great occasion. It is serious business, of course, but the Americans make sure that it is fun too.

governor 州长   federal 联邦的   senate 参议院，上院

美国的政体
华盛顿、林肯、艾森豪威尔、肯尼迪——这些美国历史上赫赫有名的人物，都曾是美国的总统。 
时至今日，美国总统是世界上最有权势的人物之一。他能发动战争，也可带来和平；他能触及诸多国家的几百万条性命，不过他也不可随心所欲。总统要做的事要事先得到国会的批准。 
在某些方面，美国像是五十个小国而不是一个统一的大国。各州均有自己的州长、自己的警察和法律。比如，在有些州，年满十八岁可以买酒精饮料，但在其他州，要等到二十一岁才行。 
整个国家的政府（联邦政府）办公地点在首都华盛顿，国会也在此。国会由两部分组成：参议院和众议院。参议院有一百名成员（称为参议员），每州两名。未经参议院同意总统不能采取任何行动。众议院有四百三十五名众议员。和参议员一样，他们可制定新法。
美国总统每四年选举一次。总统选举是个重要事件。它当然是很严肃的，不过美国人也会让其充满乐趣。


Lesson15 A Way To Catch a Thief
    Old Mrs. Robinson was a widow who lived alone in a small house. Her son John lived with his wife and child in another street, and he often said to his mother, "You must come and live with us," but she always answered, "No, I'm very happy in my little house, and I don't want to leave it."
    At eight o'clock one morning the old woman telephoned her son and said, 'Please come to my house.' Then she put the phone down. John said to his wife, "Mother wants me. Perhaps she's ill. I'll go down to have a look." He quickly drove to his mother's house. When the old woman opened the door, her son asked, "What's the matter, Mother?"
    "Come in,"she answered. "There's a thief in one of my cupboards."
    "A thief in one of your cupboards?" said John."When did you find him?"
    "I heard noises in a cupboard yesterday evening," she answered.
    "Which one?" John asked quietly. They were in the dining room now.
    "That one," the old woman answered.
    "Why didn't you telephone me then?"John asked.
    "Because it was late, and I didn't want to trouble you," she answered.
    "But the thief hasn't stayed in the cupboard all night, has he?"asked John.
    "Oh, yes, he has,"the old woman answered. "I nailed the door up, and then I went to bed."

抓贼之道
年老的罗宾逊夫人是个寡妇，独自一人住在一个小房子里。
她的儿子约翰和他的妻子、孩子住在另一条街，他经常对母亲说：“你一定要过来和我们一起住，”但她总是回答：“不，我在自己的小房子里很开心，不想离开。”
有天早晨，老太太八点钟就给儿子打电话：“到我这里来。”然后就放下了电话。
约翰对妻子说：“妈妈需要我。或许她生病了。我去看一看。”他开车很快就到了母亲的住处。
老太太打开门，她的儿子问：“什么事，妈妈？”
“进来，”她说，“有个贼在我的一个壁橱里。”
“有个贼在壁橱里？”约翰问。“你什么时候发现的？”
“昨晚我听到壁橱里有响声，”她答道。
“哪一个壁橱？”他悄悄地问。现在他们在餐厅里。
“那个，”老太太回答。
“你当时怎么不给我打电话？”约翰问。
“天晚了，而且我不想打扰你，”她答。
“但贼不会整个晚上呆在壁橱里，是不是？”约翰问。
“哦，他会的，”老太太说，“我把门给钉上，然后上床睡觉了。”


Lesson16 British homes

    British homes are usually smaller than american homes. But like americans, all people,young families and american people do not usually live together. Many brats love old houses and there are more expensive than morden ones. They also love gardening and you will see gardens everywhere you go in towns,villages and out of country.
    Some are very small with just one tree and a few flowers, others are in normal with plenty of flowers and a large of vegetables, trees to fed a family. There are 19 million homes in Britain, big homes and small homes, all the colleges and few high rise building, houses and flats. Half of families in britain own their own homes. Million of these, owner occupy houses are the same with two or three bedrooms and bathroom stairs,a sitting room,dinning rooms and kitchen downstairs and small garden at back and front of the house. To pay for their house, home owners borrow money from a building society and pay back a little every month. One third of british population live in rented stays on the homes called counsel houses. Many of these are flats. But some of house is each with small pieces of gardens. Other people rent their homes or gardens from private owners.


Lesson17 A Tiring Party
    Mr. Harris and his wife moved to another town, and they met a lot of interesting people. They often went to dinner or to parties at other people's houses. So Mr. and Mrs. Harris decided to host a big party, too.
    They chose a date, and then Mrs. Harris began to write out invitations. One of the sentences in the invitation said,"Mr. and Mrs. Harris would like the pleasure of your company at the party in their residence. The time is between 6:30 to 8:30 p.m."
"That isn't very nice, is it?"Mr. Harris said. "You're telling our guests that they must go at 8:30. So Mrs. Harris just wrote, "The party begins at 6:30 p.m."
    A lot of guests came, and they all enjoyed their time. In fact, they stayed until midnight when a policeman arrived. He said,    "You must stop the party because someone has complained."
    Mr. Harris didn't want to argue with the policeman. All the guests went home quickly. When Mr. and Mrs. Harris were alone again, she asked, "It was a surprise, wasn't it? Who complained about the noise?"
    "I did," Mr. Harris answered in a tired voice.

residence 住处

累人的聚会
哈里斯夫妇刚搬到一个小镇，并结识了很多有趣的人。两人经常到别人家里吃晚饭或聚会。他们于是决定也举办一个盛大的聚会。
他们选了个日子，然后哈里斯夫人开始写请帖。请帖里有这样一句话：“哈里斯先生和夫人很高兴大家光临在他们家里举办的聚会。时间为晚上六点半到八点半。”
“这样写不大好吧？”哈里斯先生说。“你是在告诉我们的客人必须在八点半离开。”
哈里斯夫人因此这样写：“聚会晚上六点半开始。” 
聚会那天来了很多客人，而且他们都玩得尽兴。事实上，他们一直逗留到半夜直到来了一个警察。警察说：“你们必须结束聚会，有人已经投诉了。”
哈里斯先生不想和警察争论。客人们很快就走了。只剩下夫妇俩的时候，哈里斯夫人说：“真令人惊讶，谁会嫌吵呢？”
“我嫌吵，”哈里斯先生用疲惫的声音答道。

Lesson18 Medicine
    What is medicine? And what is health? In different cultures and at different times you would have received varying answers to these questions. In the modern Western medical tradition, the main objectives are first to get rid of disease, and then to keep people healthy.
    In earlier times, Western medicine depended on a muddled mixture of prayer, folk remedies, and theories going back to the Arab civilizations and beyond that to the ancient Greeks. 
    True advances in medical care did not take place until the 1800's, and it was not until the 1900's that medicine was able to reduce the high death rates caused by infections.
    Eastern medicine took a different line. It is believed that the whole body had to be treated in order to keep it healthy and to prevent disease from appearing.
    Chinese medicine developed from a totally different background from science-based Western medicine. It treats the whole body by restoring the balance of forces flowing within it.
    Now, in the 21st century, Western medicine has begun to accept the idea of traditional Eastern medicine. There is growing interest in this and other forms of traditional medicine.

muddled 混乱的，模糊的   prayer 祈祷    remedy 治疗法

医学
医学是什么？健康是什么？不同的文化背景、不同的时期会有不同的答案。传统西医的目标是先治病，后保健。 
早先，西医是个大杂烩，有祈祷，民间秘方，及可追溯到阿拉伯文明时期、甚至古希腊时期的学说。医学直到十九世纪才有了真正的发展，到二十世纪才开始减少了由感染导致的高死亡率。
东方医学走的是一条完全不同的道路。东方医学的理念是要治疗全身使其健康，从而预防疾病的发生。
中医不同于建立在科学基础上的西医，它是在完全不同的背景下发展起来的。它通过调节全身精气的平衡来治疗疾病。
在21世纪的今天，西医已经开始接受传统东方医学的理念。人们对于各种形式的传统医学的兴趣也越来越大。


Lesson19 Don't Forget to Remember!
    Read the following sets of numbers. It shouldn't take you more than about ten seconds.
876935290143841986405
    Believe it or not, there are people who can read these numbers as quick as a flash and remember them for the rest of their lives. They have 'photographic' memories that can see something and store it in their minds forever — like a camera captures something forever on film. Scientists think that about one person in ' has this remarkable power to remember.
    A 23-year-old American university student made her mark by being able to read poems in foreign languages she had never studied. She could also recite the poems later without any help. She explained that she could 'see' the pages in her mind. To prove this, she could even say the poems backwards.
    After months of experiments with the girl, two scientists prepared a special test. They made a huge 'chessboard' with 10,000 black and white squares put down in a haphazard fashion. The girl studied the giant board for only a few minutes. Months later, she could still describe the position of all the squares perfectly!

photographic 照相的   chessboard 棋盘   haphazard 随便的，偶尔的

不要忘了记忆 ！
读一下下面几个数字。你只需要不超过10秒钟的时间。
876935290143841986405 
不管你信不信，有人可以飞快地看一下这些数字，并记住它们终身不忘。他们有照相机般的记忆力，将他们看到的东西永远储存在头脑中——就象照相机把捕捉到的图像永久地留在胶卷上一样。科学家认为大约每五千人中就有一个人拥有如此惊人的记忆力。 
一个二十三岁的美国大学生因其能够读出她从来没有学过的外语诗歌而声名大噪。她还可以稍后在没有任何帮助的情况下背诵这些诗。她解释说她可以在脑子里看到一页一页的诗。为了证明这一点，她甚至可以把诗歌倒着读出来。
两位科学家以这个女孩为对象进行了数月的研究，他们准备进行一项特别的测试。他们制作了一个巨大的“棋盘”，上面不规则地摆放了一万个黑白方块。这个女孩只花了几分钟研究这个巨大的棋盘。几个月后，她仍旧可以准确无误地描述出所有方块的位置！


Lesson20 Time Off
    Working hours are shorter, holidays are longer, and people have more time off now than ever before. What do they do with it?
    In both Britain and America, people watch TV for many hours every week. In America there is a very big choice. Many cities have twenty or more channels, sometimes going for twenty-four hours a day. In Britain there are four channels, but many people now have satellite or digital TV, offering hundreds more. Many well-off Americans have a 'camper' or 'trailer' which they can use for weekends away. Some have holiday houses in the country, and spend as much time as possible on outside activities like fishing and water-skiing.
    Fewer British people have caravans or second homes, but many have gardens, where they spend a lot of their free time. Home owners often take time doing jobs round the house. They paint, put wallpaper, build cupboards and even make furniture. There are a lot of DIY (Do It Yourself) shops all over the country selling everything they need.
    For some, time off means music and dancing. In London and New York, one or two new discos open every week. Some close again after a night or two, but some, like Tramp in London, go on, and on, and on ...

well-off 富裕的, 处境好的   camper 露营车   trailer 汽车拖的活动房屋
caravan [英国]活动住房，野营房车

休闲时光
工作时间变短了，假期变长了，如今人们有了比以往更长的休闲时光。怎么打发这些空闲时间呢？
英国人和美国人每周看很长时间的电视。在美国，可选择的电视节目相当多，许多城市有二十几个频道，有时一天二十四小时播出。英国有四个电视频道，但现在许多人有卫星或数字电视，这类电视可提供上百个频道。不少富有的美国人驾驶自己的“露营车”或“房车”外出度周末。有些人在乡村有度假房屋，花尽可能多的时间在钓鱼和滑水这样的户外运动上。
英国人很少拥有野营房车或另外的住处，但很多人有花园，把很多空闲时间花在了上面。房主经常花时间打理房子。他们粉刷、上墙纸、做橱柜，甚至制作家具。英国国内有很多的DIY（自己动手）商店，出售人们需要的每样东西。
休闲时光对有些人意味着音乐和跳舞。在伦敦和纽约，每周都会新开一两家迪斯科舞厅。有些开张后一两天马上就关了，但也有的生意一直红火，如伦敦的“Tramp”。


Lesson21 Women and the IT Industry
    The computer industry should offer ideal conditions for the employment of women. Unfortunately it doesn't, both because the computer industry's managers are too stupid to employ them, and because women have been put off by the idea that jobs involve being a slave to an inhuman computer screen.
    Computing should attract women: it is clean, light work where the best results are obtained by intelligence applied in co-operative work-groups. All large computer sites run round the clock, which provides for flexible working hours; indeed, much IT work can be done from home. Because of the pace at which the industry advances, staffs need regular skills updates, which should make it easier for women to be retrained and re-employed if they take time out to have a family.
    Nor does computing have any of the entrenched working practices which might keep women out. It does not have 100 year-old demarcation lines. The workforce is expanding, not contracting. Hiring women ought to be easy.
    Under the circumstances it is almost unbelievable that the number of women being taken in to the computing industry is declining.

entrenched 确立的，不容易改的（风俗习惯）   demarcation 分工

女性与IT行业 
计算机行业应该为女性就业提供理想的条件。但是事实并非如此，一方面是因为计算机行业的经理们太愚蠢了，不雇佣女性，另一方面也是因为女性相信这样的工作会使自己成为无人性的电脑屏幕的奴隶。
计算机业的工作应该对女性有吸引力：它干净、轻松，通过团队协作及运用智慧可以获得工作的最佳结果。所有大型的计算机房都是二十四小时工作的，它们提供灵活的工作时间，许多IT工作确实可以在家中完成。由于此行业的迅速发展，从业人员需要定期的技能更新，这一点使中断工作去照顾家庭的女性更容易接受再教育和再就业。 
计算机业也没有任何固定不变的工作惯例阻碍女性就业。它也没有那些已存在一百年的分工界限。劳动力需求正在不断扩大而非缩小。雇佣女性员工应该非常容易。
在这样的背景下，投身计算机业的女性的数量还在减少，真是令人难以置信。


Lesson22 Riding a Bike
    Mr. Holland drove to work in a car every day. When he was forty, he was fat and very soft, and he did not wish to get fatter and softer every year.
    One day one of his friends said to him, 'Would you like to be thinner, Fred?'
    'Of course I would,' Mr. Holland answered.
    'Well,' his friend said, 'stop going to your office by car, and get a bicycle.'
    Mr. Holland had not ridden a bicycle for many years. 'It's very dangerous to ride a bicycle again at your age,' his wife said.
But he bought a bicycle for his birthday and practiced riding every evening. He hoped that it would help him get thinner, and he got a lot of pleasure from practice.
    Then he began to go to his office on his bicycle. Sometimes all the cars stopped at a red light, and he went past them to the front because his bicycle was small. He was very happy.
    Yesterday he stopped at a red light, and a man came up behind him on another bicycle. He stopped too and asked Mr. Holland, 'Have the police taken your driving license away too?'

骑自行车
霍兰先生每天驾车上班。当他四十岁时，变得肥胖且很不结实，而他不愿意一年年变得越来越胖和虚弱。
一天，他的一个朋友对他说：“你想减肥吗，佛瑞德？”
“当然想了，”霍兰先生答。
“那么，”他的朋友说，“不要开车上班，骑车去。”
霍兰先生许多年不骑车了。“你这个年龄骑车很危险。”妻子说。
但他还是在生日时买了辆自行车，并且每天晚上练习骑车。他希望这能帮助自己变瘦，而且他从练习中得到了很多乐趣。
然后他开始骑车上班。有时所有的汽车因红灯停车时，因为自行车小，霍兰先生骑车超到汽车前面，他非常高兴。
昨天他停车等红灯时，一个人骑自行车从后面到他跟前。他也停下来，然后问霍兰先生：“警察也没收了你的驾驶执照了吗？”


Lesson23 The Exercise Craze
    Everybody's doing it, old and young, men and women. They're jogging, dancing, jumping up and down, bending and stretching. 
    Exercise is in fashion. Everybody wants to be fit, feel good, look slim, and stay young.
    It started with jogging. Millions of Americans put on their new colored sports shoes and fashionable jogging suits and ran through the parks or along the streets for half an hour a day. 
    Then the joggers got the marathon craze. Popular marathons are now held everywhere. Lots of people want to see if they can run 42 kms and do it faster than everyone else. The big city marathons, in London and New York, are important sporting events. Television cameras and newspapers report them in detail. Some remarkable people take part in the marathons: seventy-five-year-old grandfathers and nine-year-old grandchildren, and even invalids in wheelchairs.
    Marathons are not for everyone, some prefer to get fit at home. For them, there's a big choice of books, cassettes and video programs with music and instructions. Sometimes the action is more like dancing than exercises. That's why one big company calls it 'dancercise'.
    Taking exercise is only one part of keeping fit. You've got to get slim too. Books and magazines about slimming are bestsellers these days. Some people eat nothing but fruit for two or three days a week. It sounds terrible. Why not forget about keeping fit, sit down, and have another chocolate biscuit?

bend 弯（腰）   stretch 伸展（运动）   invalid 病人, 残废者
dancercise dance (舞蹈) exercise (锻炼) 的临时合成词   slim 苗条的

运动狂潮 
人人都在做运动，不分老少，不分男女。他们跑步、跳舞、上下跳跃、弯曲拉伸。运动是一种时尚，没有人不想身材匀称、自感满意、看起来苗条和永葆青春。 
最初是慢跑。上百万美国人穿着崭新鲜艳的运动鞋和时髦的慢跑装，每天穿过公园或沿街跑上半小时。后来慢跑者迷上了马拉松，现在各地都在举办广受欢迎的马拉松。很多人想看看自己能否跑四十二公里，而且还能比别人跑得快。伦敦和纽约两大城市的马拉松是很重要的赛事。电视和报纸都对此做详尽的报道。一些参加马拉松的人颇引人注目：有七十五岁的爷爷和九岁的孙子，甚至还有坐着轮椅的残疾人。 
不是所有的人都参加马拉松，有些人更愿意在家锻炼。他们有很多选择：书本、磁带以及配有音乐和指导的录像节目。有时这种锻炼更像跳舞，因此有个大公司称其为“舞练”。 
锻炼只是保持身体健康的一个方面。你还要保持苗条身材。有关减肥的书和杂志当今都是畅销书。有些人每周有两天或三天只吃水果，其他什么都不吃。听起来真可怕。为什么不忘掉减肥，坐下来，再吃一块巧克力饼干？


Lesson24 A Swimming Test
    Once upon a time, there was a boy named Stephen. Stephen had read a lot of books about ships and their voyages and he was fascinated by them. When he was sixteen, he decided that he wanted to become a navy officer, so he went to navy school.
    One day the teachers informed the students that they are going to have swimming and diving lessons. Stephen arrived at the pool the next morning with the other students. He was looking forward to learning to swim.
    The teacher commanded those who could not swim to go into one group, those who could swim but not dive properly to go into a second group, and those who could both swim and dive well to go into a third one. Stephen went into the second group.
    The teacher then told the students in the second group to go down into the swimming pool and swim to the other end. Stephen climbed down the steps, but as soon as he began to swim, he sank. When he did not come up again, the alarmed teacher jumped in and dragged him out of the water. Then the teacher said to Stephen, 'Why ever didn't you join the group that can't swim?'
    'Because I'd never even bathed in a pool before,' Stephen answered, 'so I didn't know whether I could swim or not.'

navy 海军   command 向……发布命令

游泳测试
从前，有个男孩叫斯蒂芬。他看了很多关于船只和航海的书，对这些很着迷。
十六岁时，他决心成为一名海军军官，因此上了海军学校。
一天，老师告知学生他们将要学习游泳和潜水。斯蒂芬第二天早晨和其他同学到了游泳池。他心中很盼望学习游泳。
老师命令不会游泳的学生组成第一组，会游泳但不大会潜水的到第二组，游泳和潜水都好的到第三组。斯蒂芬加入到了第二组。 
然后老师让第二组的学生进泳池从一头游到另一头。斯蒂芬顺阶而下，但刚开始游泳，就沉了下去。眼看他不再浮出水面，惊慌的老师跳下去把他从水中拉了上来。接着老师问他：“你为什么不加入到不会游泳的那一组呢？”
“因为之前我从未进过泳池，”斯蒂芬答道，“所以我也不知道自己会不会游泳。


Lesson25 Power
    There is not enough petrol in the world for everybody now, and each year there is less, so what are we going to do when it finishes? Perhaps we will go back to horses and carriages and bicycles.
    In the Second World War, some people did not use petrol in their cars. They made gas from wood and plants instead, and then they put it in big bags on top of their cars. The cars did not go fast, but it was better than nothing. We cannot cut down all our trees to make gas; we need them for other things too.
    Besides gas, we can also use electricity for our cars, but first we must make the electricity! Some countries have coal, and they make electricity with that, but we will not always have coal. Other countries have great rivers, which turn turbines and generate electricity more easily and cheaply.
    We are also able to get power from the tides. We put turbines in the mouth of a river. Then, when the tide comes up, it turns the turbines, and when it runs back towards the sea, it turns them again. We know that the waves of the sea can also turn turbines when they go up and down. Will all of these things generate our electricity in the year 2050?

petrol 汽油   turbine 水轮机    generate 发（电）

能源
现在世界上没有足够的汽油供应每个人，并且每年都在减少，那么汽油用完后我们打算怎么办？或许我们将回头使用马、马车和自行车。 
在第二次世界大战中，有些国家的汽车不使用汽油。他们用树木和植物制造天然气，然后将天然气放进汽车顶上的大袋子里。这种汽车跑不快，但总比没有好。我们不能砍倒所有的树来制造天然气；我们还需它们做别的事情。 
除了天然气，我们还可以在汽车上使用电能，但首先我们必须发电！有些国家有煤，因此他们用煤发电，但我们不会一直有煤。别的国家有大河，可以驱动水轮机发电，这比较容易和廉价。 
我们也能从潮汐中获得能源。把水轮机放在河口，然后当潮水上涨的时候，它能驱动水轮机，而退潮时，又能驱动水轮机。我们知道大海的波浪在涨落时也能使水轮机旋转。所有这些能不能提供我们2050年所需的电力呢？


Lesson26 Come to a Party!
    Most parties are quite relaxed these days, especially young people's parties. You don't have to wear a long dress or a black tie when you want to have a good time. In fact, you can usually wear what you like — anything from jeans to suits and dresses. British and American people are often quite informal.
    People will expect an answer even to an informal invitation. 
    Just call to say if you can or cannot come. Some people of course (especially older ones) still enjoy formal parties. An invitation to a smart party often has RSVP written at the bottom. This is short for the French phrase responde si vous plait. It means that you must write a letter or telephone to say if you can or cannot come. People often send out invitations weeks before a party. It's polite to answer as soon as possible.
    What do you do if someone asks you to 'tea'? For some British people, 'tea' means a cup of tea and a biscuit at 4:30 or 5 p.m. For others, 'tea' means a meal at 6:30 or 7 p.m. 'Formal dress' usually means a suit and tie for men, and a smart dress for women. 'Black tie' means that the men wear dinner jackets and the women wear evening dresses. 'Black tie' is only for very special occasions.

smart party 正式的聚会、社交活动

聚会去！ 
今天的聚会大多相当随意，尤其是年轻人的聚会。想要玩得高兴，你不需长礼服或半正式礼服。事实上，你一般喜欢穿什么就穿什么——从牛仔到套装和礼服。英美两国的人常常穿得很休闲。 
即使是一个非正式邀请，人们也会期待一个回复。你只要打个电话告知会不会去。当然，有些人（尤其是年纪大些的）仍然喜欢正式的聚会。一个高雅聚会的邀请函经常在底部写着RSVP。这是法语responde si vous plait的简写。它的意思是你必须写信或打电话答复是否会来。邀请大都在聚会前几周发出。尽快答复是礼貌的做法。
如果有人邀请你“喝茶”，你会怎么做？对英国人来说，“喝茶”意味着在下午四点半或五点喝杯茶，吃点饼干。对有的国家的人来说，“喝茶”指在晚上六点半或七点吃饭。“正式礼服”一般指男人穿的套装和领带，以及女人穿的时髦的裙装。“小礼服”指男宾穿无尾礼服，女宾穿晚礼服。“小礼服”仅在非常特殊的场合才会穿。


Lesson27 "Just Leave the Keys in, Sir."
    Stan Murch, in a uniform-like blue jacket, stood on the sidewalk in front of the Hilton and watched cab after cab make the loop in to the main entrance. Doesn't anybody travel in their own car any more? Then at last a Chrysler Imperial with Michigan plates came hesitantly up Sixth Avenue, made the left-hand loop into the Hilton driveway and stopped at the entrance. As a woman and several children got out of the doors on the right of the car, toward the hotel entrance, the driver climbed heavily out on the left. He was a big man with a cigar and a camel's-hair coat.
    Murch was at the door before it was halfway open, pulling it the rest of the way and saying, "Just leave the keys in, sir."
"Right," the man said around his cigar. He got out and sort of shook himself inside the coat. Then, as Murch was about to get behind the wheel, the driver said, "Wait."
Much looked at him. "Sir?"
"Here you go, boy," the man said and pulled a folded dollar bill from his pants pocket and handed it across.
"Thank you, sir," Murch said. He saluted with the hand holding the dollar, climbed behind the wheel, and drove away. He was smiling as he made the right turn into 53rd Street; it wasn't every day a man gave you a tip for stealing his car.

“先生，请把钥匙留在里面吧。”
斯坦&#8226;默奇穿着酷似制服的兰色夹克，站在希尔顿饭店前面的人行道上，看着出租车一辆接着一辆拐入大门口前。难道不再有人自己开车旅行了吗？终于一辆密歇根州牌照的克莱斯勒皇家轿车犹豫地驶入第六大街，左转弯进入了希尔顿饭店的车道，停在了入口处。一个女人和几个孩子从车右边的门下来，朝酒店大门走去，驾车人艰难地从左边爬出来。那是一个抽着雪茄，穿着驼毛大衣，体形硕大的男人。默奇在车门半开前就站到了车门旁，把门拉开，说，“先生，请把钥匙留在里面吧。”
“好的，”那人叼着烟卷说。他下了车，抖动着身体穿上大衣。当默奇正要坐到驾驶座上时，那男人说，“等等。”
默奇看着他。“先生？”
“给你，”男人说着从裤子口袋里拉出一张叠好的美元钞票递了过去。
“谢谢，先生，” 
默奇说。他接过美元行了一个礼，爬上车，驾车离开。他微笑着右转进入了五十三大街。偷车还给小费，这种好事可不是每天都有的。


Lesson28 Religion
    A hundred years ago, life in Europe and the USA was very different. Then, nearly everyone went to a church or synagogue once a week. Now, many people never go at all. Religion is still important though, especially to the Americans.
    In the States, over 60% of the population goes to a church or synagogue. There are over 70 million Protestants, nearly 50 million Roman Catholics, and over 6 million Jews. Religion is an important part of American life. Americans like their President to be a religious man. They spend a lot of money on beautiful new churches, and many of them enjoy modern services with plenty of music and drama.
    British people are less interested in religion than Americans. 
    About 16% go to church. Of these, 2.5 million are Protestants, and 1.5 million are Roman Catholics. There are also about one million Muslims and 400,000 Jews in Britain. Religion still plays a part in British life. There are beautiful old cathedrals and churches in every town and village, many people prefer to get married in a church and lots of people go to church at Christmas and Easter, the two main Christian festivals. For a long time, fewer and fewer British people have gone to church, but now things seem to be changing. The churches are very slowly growing again.

synagogue 犹太教会堂   Protestant 新教徒   Catholic 天主教徒

宗教 
一百年前，欧洲人和美国人的生活有很大不同。那时几乎人人每周去一次教堂或犹太教会堂，而现在有许多人从不去教堂。但是宗教仍然很重要，尤其对美国人来说。 
超过百分之六十的美国人去教堂或犹太教会堂。美国有约七千多万清教徒，近五千万罗马天主教徒，六百多万犹太教徒。宗教在美国人生活中占有重要地位。美国人希望他们的总统是一个信奉宗教的人。他们花很多钱兴建崭新漂亮的教堂，许多人喜欢有大量音乐和戏剧的现代宗教仪式。 
英国人没有美国人那样对宗教感兴趣。信奉宗教的人大约占总人口的百分之十六，其中两百五十万是新教徒，一百五十万是罗马天主教徒。英国还有大约一百万穆斯林和四十万犹太教徒。宗教在英国人的生活中依然占有一席之地。每个城镇村庄都有漂亮的古老大教堂和普通教堂。人们大多选择在教堂结婚，在圣诞节和复活节这两个基督教的重要节日，很多人会到教堂做礼拜。很长一段时间以来，去教堂的英国人越来越少了。但情况现在看来有所改观，到教堂做礼拜的人在逐渐增多。


Lesson29 Unlucky in Love
During the war, a pilot was shot down over enemy territory. 
    Fortunately, he was saved from his burning plane by a group of nuns from a nearby convent. He was knocked unconscious during the crash landing, and when he came to, he was astonished to find a woman leaning over him.
It was Sister Maria, the nun in charge. She said to the pilot, 'This convent is a teaching hospital. We have many young girls here, learning how to be nurses. We will hide you here as long as possible, but you will have to obey very strict rules.' The pilot promised to obey the rules. 'I'll do what you say. You can bank on it,' he said.
    The pilot agreed to disguise himself as a nurse. He was not allowed to talk with either the nuns or the nurses. He had to stay in his small room as much as possible. By shaving twice a day, wearing a wig and a nurse's uniform, he was able to fool anybody at a distance. It was a difficult life, however. He felt very lonely, especially when one of the students caught his eye. She was very quiet and shy, and turned her head whenever she saw him looking her way. The pilot fell in love with her, and thought of her constantly. But he never tried to speak to her.
    One day, however, the pilot could stand it no longer, and broke his promise. He found the nurse working in the kitchen. 
He crossed over to her and said, 'Please don't turn away. I've fallen in love with you.' He started to put his arms around the nurse, and then stepped back in amazement.
    The shy nurse was another pilot in disguise!

convent 女修道院    disguise 假装    wig 假发

不幸的爱情 
战争期间，一个飞行员在敌方上空被击落了。幸运的是，附近修道院里的一群修女把他从燃烧的飞机里救了出来。他在飞机撞击地面时震晕了，当他苏醒过来时，他惊异地发现身边有名妇女在照料他。 
她是修女玛利亚，修女们的主管。她对飞行员说：“这所修道院是教学医院。我们这里有许多年轻姑娘，她们正在学习护士课程。我们会尽可能地把你藏在这里，但是你必须严格遵守这里的规定。”飞行员承诺遵守这些规定。“我会按照你说的做。请放心。” 
飞行员答应把自己假扮成护士。他不能和修女或其他护士讲话。他必须尽量待在自己的小房间里。他每天刮两次胡子，戴着假发，穿着护士服，只要隔开一段距离就没人能认得出他。然而，这样的生活是艰难的。他感到非常孤独，尤其是当他注意到其中一个学生时。那个学生非常安静、害羞，每次她看到飞行员在远处看她时，她总会转过头去。飞行员爱上了她，无时不刻地想她，但他克制住自己不和她说话。 
然而，有一天，飞行员再也忍不住了，他违背了诺言。他发现那个护士正在厨房做事，就走上前去，对她说：“请不要转过身去。我已经爱上了你。”他正要伸出双臂揽住那个护士，随即却又惊异地退了回来。
害羞的护士其实是另一个假扮的飞行员！


Lesson30 Birthdays
    For British and American people, birthdays are very special days, especially for children. Parents and family members send cards and give presents. Often children invite their friends, who bring presents to the party. There are games, and prizes, and a birthday "tea" with sandwiches, biscuits, ice cream and a birthday cake. There are small candles on the cake. When the little guests leave, they each get a small present and a balloon.
Birthdays are special days for older people too. Family members and friends give presents, and send birthday cards. 
When people meet someone on their birthday sometimes even at work, they say "Happy birthday!" or "Many happy returns of the day!"
    The most important birthday in the US is the eighteenth. When you are eighteen, you are grown up. You can vote, you can get married, and you can even go to prison! People often have a big party on their eighteenth birthday, and receive a lot of presents. In the UK, the most important birthday is the twenty-first, and many Brits throw huge parties for that event.
Fortieth and seventieth birthdays are also rather special, and in Britain, if you live to be a hundred, the Queen sends you her congratulations.

vote 投票   throw ... party举办派对、聚会等活动

生日 
对于英国人和美国人来说，生日是很特殊的日子，尤其对小孩来讲。父母和家庭成员送生日卡和礼物。小孩常常邀请他们的朋友，朋友会带着礼物参加生日聚会。聚会上有游戏、奖品，还有三明治、饼干、冰激凌和生日蛋糕等生日“茶点”。蛋糕上有小蜡烛。小客人们走的时候，每人可得到一份小礼物和一个气球。 
生日这天对成人来说也是很特殊的一天。家庭成员和朋友赠送礼物，送来生日贺卡。甚至有时工作的时候碰到过生日的人，他们也会说：“生日快乐！”，或“恭祝快乐无限多！” 
美国人最重要的生日是十八岁生日。当你年满十八，你就成人了。你能选举、结婚，甚至去坐牢！十八岁时，人们常会举行盛大的派对，并收到很多礼物。在英国，二十一岁的生日最重要，许多英国人为此安排盛大的聚会。
四十岁和七十岁的生日也相当特殊。在英国，如果你能活到一百岁，女王会对你表示祝贺。


Lesson31 Two Hotels
    Mr. Gray often travels to rural areas to sell machines to farmers. One of his problems has always been finding proper lodging for himself, and often when he reached a small village he would be given a cold room with no hot water or good food after a long and tiring day.
    Late one evening, Mr. Gray arrived at a small railway station. The journey by train that day had not been at all interesting, and Mr. Gray was cold, tired, and hungry. He was looking forward to a satisfying meal by a burning fire, and then a hot bath and comfortable bed.
    While he was leaving the exit of the station, he asked a local man, "Excuse me, I#m a stranger here in this town. Can you help me find a hotel to put me up for a night?" The man looked at him up and down and then replied, "There are altogether two hotels in our town ..." "Which one would you advise me to go to?""Mr. Gray asked hurriedly before he could finish. The local man scratched his head for a few moments and then answered, "Well, it#s like this: whichever one you go to, you will be sorry that you didn#t go to the other."

lodging 住所    put up for 给……安排过夜   scratch 搔, 抓

两家旅店 
格雷先生常去偏远地方向农夫出售机器。为自己找一个合适的住所是他经常遇到的一个问题。每当结束漫长而劳累的一天到达一个小村庄时，经常只有既无热水也无美食的冰冷房间。 
一天深夜，格雷先生到了一个铁路小站。那天火车上的旅程实在无趣，而且格雷先生浑身发冷，又累又饿，他很想坐在炉火旁美美地吃上一顿，然后洗个热水澡，舒服地进入梦乡。 
离开出站口时，他问一个当地人：“打扰一下，我第一次到这里。你能帮我找个住一晚的旅店吗？”那人上下打量他一番回答：“我们镇总共有两家旅店……”“你建议我住哪一家？”格雷先生不等他说完就急忙问道。当地人挠挠头，过了一会儿说：“哎呀，这么说吧。无论你住了哪家，你都会后悔没住另一家。”


Lesson32 Have a Nice Holiday!
    Most British people take a two-week holiday in July or August, when the schools are closed, but shops, offices and factories do not usually close for the holidays. If people can afford it, they go abroad, to sunny Italy, Spain or Greece.
    In the States, the school summer holidays are longer than in Britain (nearly three months in the States, six or seven weeks in Britain). American families often go out of town to the country for the hot summer months. Many stay at work in the cities or visit their families at weekends.
    When some people are on holiday, they like just sitting in the sun, but others want a bit more. 'Special interest' holidays are very popular today. Do you like riding? Why not see the Grand Canyon in Arizona, USA, on horseback?
What about a winter holiday? There are hundreds of ski resorts in the mountains of the USA, the Rockies, the Sierra Nevada and the Appalachians. You can ski in Britain too.
    Perhaps you prefer to be less energetic? Try a painting holiday, or a musical holiday, or even a computer holiday. You get some hours of teaching every day, meet other people who share your special interest, and have time to relax as well in a pleasant country hotel or college campus.

ski resort 滑雪胜地

假日愉快！ 
大多数英国人在七月或八月休假两周。这期间学校不上课，但商店、政府机关和工厂并不休息。如果能承担得起开销，他们就到国外度假，到阳光明媚的意大利、西班牙或希腊。 
美国中小学的暑假比英国的长（美国有将近三个月，英国只有六到七周）。美国人经常全家到城外的乡村打发炎热的夏季。许多人留在城市工作，或在周末探访朋友。
暑假有些人只热衷晒晒日光浴，另有些人不满足于此。“特别爱好”假日现在很风行。喜欢骑马吗？何不骑马游览美国亚利桑那州的大峡谷？
寒假怎么过呢？美国落基山脉、内华达山脉和阿巴拉契亚山脉有几百个滑雪胜地，在英国你也可以滑雪。 
或许你想要运动量小一点？尝试一下绘画假日，或者音乐假日，甚或计算机假日。每天你听课学习几小时，跟与你有同样特殊爱好的人碰面，且还有时间在令人愉快的乡村旅店或大学校园放松身心。


Lesson33 Sorry! I'm Late
    In Britain and the USA most people are careful about time.
    If they want to see a friend, or meet a business colleague, they telephone first to make an appointment. A lot of people don't like surprises. They want to know when a visitor is going to arrive.
    Have you arranged to meet someone at 3 o'clock? It's polite to arrive a few minutes early. Of course, everyone is late occasionally. Cars break down, trains are delayed and meetings go on too long. If you're late, just say sorry, and explain what happened. Sometimes it's impossible to keep an appointment, but if you don't arrive, the other person will be upset. Call them to explain.
    Some people usually spend time chatting and drinking tea or coffee before they start a business meeting — but not in Britain or the USA. There, they like to talk about business first and chat later — if there's time.
    Office hours in Britain and the USA are from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m., but some offices open at 8:30. People usually take about one hour for lunch (between 12 and 2). Shops open at 9 or 9:30, and stay open until 5:30 or 6. Most shops are open all day on Saturday, and are closed all day on Sunday.

抱歉！我迟到了
英国人和美国人大都很在意时间。
如果他们要拜访朋友或会见业务伙伴，会首先打个电话预约。许多人不喜欢不速之客。他们希望了解客人将在何时到达。 
你曾安排三点与人会面吗？提前几分钟到是礼貌的做法。当然，每个人偶尔都有迟到的时候。车坏了，火车晚点了，会议开得太晚了。如果迟到了，要致歉并解释一下原因。有时不可能准时赴约了，但你不到，会让对方失望，那就打个电话解释一下。
有些国家，人们通常在开会前聊聊天，喝杯茶或咖啡——但英国或美国不这样。这两个国家的人喜欢先谈正事，有时间的话再聊天。 
英国和美国的办公时间是早上九点到下午五点，但一些政府机关八点半上班。午餐时间约为一小时（十二点到两点之间）。商店九点或九点半开门，一直营业到晚上五点半或六点。大多数商店星期六全天营业，星期天休息。


Lesson34 Too Tired To Have a Holiday
    Mary Williams lived alone and had a very important job in a company. She worked very hard. She often worked late. And she even worked on weekends.
    Jill Thomas was Mary's best friend, but Jill was married, and she did not want to work all the time. "I'm quite happy at home with Len when we are not working,'she always said. "I want to enjoy my life.'
Jill and Len both enjoyed hiking and dancing very much. Nearly every weekend they went hiking and dancing. Then they would go and dance through the evening. When they had their holidays, they would climb mountains, swim and sail on lakes and dance nearly all the time.
    Once Jill said to Mary, "Would you like to have a holiday with us this year, Mary?" Mary was very happy, so Jill and Mary and Len had two weeks together. Mary enjoyed her holiday, but she was very tired after they had climbed all the mountains, swam and danced every day and every night.
    The next summer, Jill offered to take Mary on their holiday again.
    "Thank you very much," answered Mary, "but I'm going to be quite honest with you: I'm sorry that I can't come, because I've worked a lot this year and I'm tired. I don't need a holiday: I need to rest!"

hiking 徒步旅行

累得不想度假
玛丽&#8226;威廉姆斯一个人生活，在一家公司任重要职务。她工作很努力，经常工作到很晚，甚至周末也工作。
吉尔&#8226;托玛斯是玛丽最好的朋友，但吉尔结婚了，而且她不愿始终处于工作状态。“利恩和我不上班的时候，我很乐意和他呆在家。”她总说，“我要享受人生。”
吉尔和利恩都非常喜欢徒步旅行和跳舞。几乎每个周末他们都去徒步旅行和跳舞。另外他们晚上也跳舞。度假时，他们几乎一直在爬山、游泳、在湖上驾驶帆船和跳舞。
吉尔有次对玛丽说：“今年愿意和我们度假吗，玛丽？”玛丽很乐意，因此吉尔和玛丽，还有利恩一起度了两周假。玛丽假期玩的很开心，但在他们爬完所有要爬的山、整天游泳和跳舞之后，她感到非常疲倦。
第二年夏天，吉尔再次邀请玛丽和他们一起度假。
“非常感谢，”玛丽回答，“但我想坦率的告诉你：很抱歉我不能去，因为今年我做了很多工作，很累。我不需要假期，只需要休息！”


Lesson35 A Tender Heart
Peter was a ten year-old student at a city school. He was very good at football, playing forward on the school team.
Peter's grandfather and grandmother usually came to see him when there was an important match. One day Peter said to his grandmother, "Our school's going to play against Garden School next Saturday. Can you come and see the match?""Oh, yes," his grandmother answered, "We love to see you play in the match."
The match took place in the park at half past two on Saturday. 
In the first two minutes of the match, the boys from Garden School came very close to the City School's goal, but then the goalkeeper kicked the ball to Peter in the middle of the field, and Peter ran with it and kicked it straight into the goal. After he had scored once, Peter scored twice again before half time. In the second half of the match peter began to appear weird in the play. He missed the goal at the short distance when nobody was in his way.
After the match, Peter's grandfather said to him, "You missed a good chance to score a fourth goal Peter. If you'd kicked the ball harder, you'd have got a goal easily. Why didn't you kick it hard then?""Because there were tears in the goalkeeper's eyes", Peter answered.

恻隐之心
十岁的彼得是一个市区学校的学生。他擅长踢足球，在校队里踢前锋。
有重要比赛时，彼得的祖父母就去看他踢球。一天，彼得问祖母：“下周六我们学校和花园学校比赛，你们能来吗？”
“噢，会去看的，”他的祖母回答。“我们喜欢看你踢球。”
比赛于周六两点半在公园进行。比赛开始后的前两分钟，花园学校队的队员逼近市区学校队的球门，但是守门员把球踢给在中场的彼得，然后彼得带球飞奔，并径直把球踢进对方球门。得分后，半场休息前他又两次射门而入。下半场，彼得在场上的表现匪夷所思。他在无人阻挡的情况下，近距离射门失败。
赛后，彼得的祖父对他说：“你错过了第四次进球的好机会，彼得。如果你踢得再狠一点的话，你会轻松得分的。为什么不好好踢了？”“因为守门员的眼里满是泪水，”彼得回答。


Lesson36 Look Quickly
Jack joined the Boy Scouts when he was twelve. The teachers were very nice, and Jack began to learn a lot of useful things, so he was very happy.
One day the teacher came to the camp to teach Jack and the other young Scouts to read a map. He showed them what represented a river and how to find out the elevation. "Now," the teacher went on, "how can we find out whether we can see one place from another?" Nobody answered. "Well," the teacher continued, "if there's a higher place on a straight line between them, it will be impossible for us to see one from the other, won't it?"
The teacher continued to question the boys. "Do you see the tree on this mountain over here?" He pointed it out to the boys. "It's 120 meters above sea level. Here's the problem for you: if I was beside the tree, and you were in the middle of the river, Jack, would I be able to see you?
Jack looked at the map carefully and then answered, "Yes, sir, you definitely would — if you looked very quickly."
The teacher was surprised. "What nonsense!" he said." What ever do you mean?There's nothing between the tree and the river which is so high that it prevents me from seeing you, so why would I have to look quickly?"
"Because I can't swim," Jack answered.

赶快看
杰克十二岁时参加了男童子军。老师们都很和蔼，而且杰克学到很多有用的知识，所以他很开心。 
一天，有个老师来到营地教杰克和其他小童子军识别地图。他告诉他们什么代表河流以及如何算出海拔。“现在，”老师接着说，“我们怎样知道能否从某地看到另一地？” 
无人应答。
“这样，”老师继续道，“如果有一较高的地方位于两地之间的一条直线上，我们就不可能从此地看到彼地，是不是啊？” 
老师接着提问男孩们：“你们看到这边这座山上的树吗？”他指给男孩们看，“它高于海平面一百二十米。现在的问题是：如果我在树旁边，而你在河的中间，杰克，我能不能看到你？”
杰克仔细看看地图，然后回答：“是的，先生，你肯定能看到——如果你赶快看的话。”
老师很惊讶。“无稽之谈！”他说，“你想说什么？树和河之间没有任何高到足以阻碍我看到你的东西，我为什么必须赶快看？”
“因为我不会游泳，”杰克答道。


Lesson37 Come to Dinner!
    Some British and American people like to invite friends and colleagues for a meal at home. Don't be upset if your English friends don't invite you home. It doesn't mean they don't like you!
    Dinner parties usually start between 7 and 8 pm and end at about 11. Ask your host what time you should arrive. It's polite to bring flowers, chocolates or a bottle of wine to your hostess.
    Usually the evening starts with drinks and snacks. Do you want to be extra polite? Say how much you like the room, or the pictures, or your hostess's dress, but remember — it's not polite to ask how much things cost.
    Dinner will usually start at about 8 or 9 o'clock. In many families, the husband sits at one end of the table and the wife sits at the other end. They eat with their guests.
    You'll probably start the meal with soup, or something small as a 'starter', and then you'll have meat or fish with vegetables, and then a dessert, followed by coffee. It's polite to finish everything on your plate and to take more if you want it. Some people eat bread with their meal, but not everyone does.
    Did you enjoy the evening? Remember to call your hostess the next day, or write her a short 'thank you' letter.

starter 开胃小食

去赴宴！ 
有些英国人和美国人喜欢邀请朋友和同事到家里吃饭。如果你的英语国家的朋友没有邀请你去家里，不要失望。这并不表示他们不喜欢你。 
晚餐派对通常开始于晚上七点到八点之间，结束于大约十一点。问清主人你应该几点到。给女主人带束鲜花、一些巧克力或一瓶酒，是礼貌的做法。 
晚会开始时，一般先喝饮料和吃点小吃。想更礼貌些吗？说说你多么喜欢主人的房间、绘画，或者女主人的礼服，但切记——询问东西的价格是不礼貌的。
晚餐通常在八、九点钟开始。在大多数家庭，丈夫坐在餐桌的一头，妻子坐在另一头。他们和客人一起吃饭。 
晚饭一开始可能是汤，或者是如“开胃菜”这样的小菜，然后你会吃到搭配蔬菜的肉或鱼，之后是甜点，最后是咖啡。吃完你盘子里的所有东西，想吃的话再加一些，这样显得礼貌。有的人吃饭的时候也吃面包，但不是人人如此。
你对晚会满意吗？记得第二天给女主人打个电话，或给她写个简短的致谢便条。


Lesson38 A Stop Sign
Sam was a farmer. He was born on his farm and had lived on it all his life. He had married his neighbour's daughter, and they grew fruit and vegetables.
Sam got up at five o'clock every morning to gather them and take a load off to the market in his truck.
There were very few vehicles on the country roads at that time of the morning and Sam knew how to get to the market very well. So as he was going along, he was always thinking about everything except his driving.
One morning he was thinking about what crops to plant for the next year's harvest, and whether to try something else. After a few kilometres, Sam came to an intersection with a stop sign. He always crossed the road without stopping because there was never any traffic on it at that time of the morning. 
But this morning a young policeman whom he had never seen before signalled to him to stop a hundred meters beyond the crossroads.
The policeman said to him, "Didn't you know that there was a sign telling you to stop at the crossroads before going over the main road?"
"Oh, yes," answered Sam, "I knew that there was a sign at that point, because I go to market along this road every morning. 
But what I didn't know was that you were here."

intersection 十字路口，交叉点   signal 发信号，用动作示意

停车标志
萨姆是个农夫。他出生在他的这个农场，一辈子都没离开过。他娶了邻居的女儿，两人种植水果和蔬菜。
萨姆每天五点起床，采摘蔬果，然后装一卡车送到市场上去。
清晨的那个时候，村里的路上没有多少车，而且萨姆对去市场的路很熟悉。因此在去市场的路上，他总是在想除开车以外的事情。 
一天早晨，他正在想下年种什么庄稼能丰收，是否试着种些其他作物。开车走了几公里后，萨姆来到一个有停车标志的十字路口。因为早晨的那个时间从来没有其他车辆经过这里，他总是不停车就闯过去。但今天早晨，通过十字路口几百米后，一个从未见过的年轻警察向他示意停车。
警察问他：“你不知道那个指示牌是说，驶入大路前要在十字路口停车吗？”
“噢，知道，”萨姆回答，“我知道那儿有个指示牌，因为我天天早晨走这条路到市场，但我不知道的是你在这儿呀。”



Lesson39 "Anyone Can Sign a Ticket."
The police say hundreds of offenders have been caught by Mrs. 
Gordon, a citizen who writes down the license numbers of people who break the law in this way, and sends them into the local police station.
"Anyone can sign a ticket,"said a police office, "and she's signed a lot."
A driver was heading down Clifton Avenue this morning, when she found herself stopped behind a school bus with its red lights flashing. Instead of stopping, the driver started to overtake the bus. But Mrs. Gordon was on the spot, and warned her not to do it. However, the driver passed the bus anyway, and Mrs. Gordon took her number.
Another driver received a summons in the mail after a similar incident a few weeks ago. When she entered the courtroom, she found Mrs. Gordon there, notebook in hand."They tell me I should be a policewoman, but I don't want to be," says Mrs. 
Gordon. "It's just that these people are breaking the law, and they shouldn't."
Every weekday morning Mrs. Gordon stands in front of the main supermarket, notebook and pencil at the ready, waiting to catch people passing school buses illegally. "Nobody else wants to be bothered,"she says, "but I won't just sit there twiddling my thumbs. I want to do something about it."She began her personal campaign a year ago when her 13-year-old Jack started taking the school bus.
But the job is getting harder. She used to give the police the license numbers and sign a complaint, but now they want more evidence before they will act. She must now give a description of the car and the driver, as well as appear in court personally. A lot of people know she's there, and make a pint of stopping, but she knows they wouldn't stop if she wasn't watching.

overtake 赶上，追上
summon 传唤，传唤到庭

“每个人都可以开罚单。”
警方宣称，市民戈登女士已经抓获了数百个交通违章者，她把违章者的汽车牌照号记下来，再把它们交给当地警察局。
“每个人都可以开罚单，” 一个警官说，“她已经开了许多罚单。” 
一天早晨，一个人驾车沿着克利夫顿大街行驶，她发现前面停着一辆闪着红灯的校车，她没有停车，反而试图超过那辆校车。戈登女士正在现场，她警告那个人不要那样做，但她仍旧驾车超过了校车。 
戈登女士记下了她的牌照号码。
几星期前，另一个人也因为类似的事情而收到了传票。当她走进法庭时，发现戈登女士也在那里，手里拿着笔记本。 
“他们说我应该去做警察，但是我不想，” 戈登女士说。 “我那么做是因为这些人违反了法律，而他们是不应该那么做的。” 
每个工作日的早晨，戈登女士站在大超市前，准备好笔和笔记本，等着抓那些非法超校车的人。“没有人愿意自找麻烦，”她说，“但是我不想无聊地坐着拨弄拇指。我要对这种违法的事情采取行动。一年前，当她十三岁的孩子吉克开始乘校车时，戈登女士就开始行动起来了。 
不过这事越来越难做了。她以前只要把汽车牌照号码交给警察，并签署申诉单就行了，但是现在警察们希望在采取行动前能得到更多的证据。戈登女士现在必须描述出车和司机的样子，还要亲自出庭作证。许多人知道她蹲守的地方，就稍微刹下车，但是她知道如果她不在那里看着，他们是不会停下来的。


Lesson40 Fast Food
Everyone is always in a hurry these days. No one has time to sit and enjoy a meal with a friend. People want to eat now and they want to eat fast. The fast food industry tries to give them what they want, when they want it. It's an industry that's getting bigger all the time.
The big names in American fast food are now well known all over the world. McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Burger King sell pizzas, chips, hot dogs, hamburgers and fried chicken from Los Angeles to London and Tokyo to Turin.
These multi-million dollar companies work hard to get more customers. Colourful lights and TV advertisements are not enough. The waitresses wear special uniforms. There are lots of big mirrors and bright colours. Many of the fast food restaurants have special offers for families, and do their best to attract children. Some even organize children's birthday parties. For busy mothers with no ideas and plenty of money, a birthday party at McDonald's can save a lot of time and trouble.
But you can't eat fast food all the time. Doctors say chips make you fat, and dentists say coca cola spoils your teeth. 
It's the old, old story — everything that's nice is bad for you!

快餐 
时下人们总是匆匆忙忙。没人有空坐下来和朋友一起享用一餐。人们想要马上就吃并且要吃得快。快餐业尽量在人们需要时给他们提供想吃的食物。快餐业是一个一直在不断增长的行业。 
美国快餐业的巨头现在全球闻名。从洛杉矶到伦敦，从东京到都灵，都有麦当劳、肯德基和汉堡王出售匹萨饼、薯条、热狗、三明治和炸鸡块。 
这些拥有上亿美元资产的公司努力吸引更多的顾客。仅有多彩的霓虹和有趣的电视广告还不够，女招待需穿着特别的制服，还有许多大大的镜子和明亮的色彩。许多快餐馆推出了面向家庭的特别服务，并竭尽全力吸引儿童。有些甚至为孩子组织生日聚会。对没时间、没创意但有大把钱的母亲来说，在麦当劳过生日能节省不少时间和麻烦。
不过你不能总吃快餐。医生说薯条会让你发胖，牙医也说可口可乐损坏牙齿。诱人的东西一定有害处！这是古训。



Lesson41 Work in a Bank
While Bill left school, he hoped to get himself a proper job. 
"I'll work in a bank," he said to himself, "because my uncle works in one".
He went to his aunt and said, "I want to work in a bank like Uncle Bob." His aunt smiled, but didn't say anything. When Bill's uncle came home that evening, his wife told him that Bill wanted to work in a bank. His uncle agreed that it was a good idea.
So Bill went to one of the banks and got a job. "You can work here for a month," the manager said, "and if you're good enough, you can stay. You"ll work with Mr. Unwin. He'll take you round and train you."
Mr. Unwin was one of the clerks in the bank, and he had been there for many years. He took Bill around the bank, and Bill learned a lot of things from him.
Then one day Mr. Unwin gave Bill some ten-pound notes. "Count these," he ordered him. "There ought to be one thousand there. 
If there aren't, let me know right away."
Bill began to count the notes, but he quickly became bored, and when he had counted half of them, he became impatient. 
"Five hundred ten, five hundred twenty, five hundred thirty," he counted. Then he stopped, looked at Mr. Unwin and pointed at the pile of notes.
"Well," he said, "if they're correct up to here, they'll all be correct, won't they?"

note （英国的）纸币

在银行工作
比尔从学校毕业时，希望能找份体面的工作。“我要到银行工作，”他心想，“我的叔父就是一个银行职员。”
他对婶婶说：“我想像鲍勃叔父那样到银行工作。”他的婶婶笑笑，没说什么。比尔的叔父那晚回家后，他的妻子告诉他比尔想到银行工作。比尔的叔父认为这个想法不错。
于是比尔到了一家银行工作。“你先在这里干一个月，”经理说，“如果干得好，你就留下。你将和安文先生一起工作，他会带你熟悉环境，并指导你工作。”
安文先生是在银行工作多年的职员。比尔跟着他熟悉了银行环境，并从他那里学到很多东西。
一天，安文先生交给比尔一叠十英镑的纸币。“数一数，”他命令道，“这些应该是一千英镑。如果不是，马上告诉我。”
比尔开始数，但很快就生厌了，数了一半，他失去了耐心。“五百一十、五百二十、五百三十”他数道。然后他停下来，指着那堆钱，看着安文先生。
“好啦，”他说，“如果数到现在都是对的，那剩下的也不会错的，对不对？”


Lesson42 An Affable Man
J.S. Minion was a maintenance foreman in the Public Works department of Excelsior City. He was a favorite of the senior officials at City Hall. They all praised his unfailing affability.
"I like Minion,"said the Superintendent of Works. "He has good judgment and is always pleasant and agreeable."
This behavior was appropriate for Minion's position: he was not supposed to make policy, so he had no need to disagree with his superiors.
The Superintendent of Works retired and Minion succeeded him. Minion continued to agree with everyone. He passed on to his foreman every suggestion that came from above. The resulting conflicts in policy, and the continual changing of plans, soon demoralized the department. Complaints poured in from the Mayor and other officials, from taxpayers and from the maintenance workers"union. The Maintenance Department regularly exceeds its budget, yet fails to fulfill its program of work.Minion still says "Yes" to everyone, and carries messages briskly back and forth between his superiors and his subordinates.

unfailing 经久不衰的，无穷尽的    affability 和蔼，亲切

一个和蔼可亲的人
密尼是埃克斯塞尔市公共事业部的一个维修工长。市政厅里的高级办公人员都很喜欢他。他们都赞赏他，因为他总是和蔼可亲。
“我喜欢密尼，”公共事业部的主管说。“他有很好的判断力，总是和蔼可亲容易相处。”
这样的举止与密尼的职位很相配：他无权决策，所以他没有必要与领导的意见相左。
事业部的主管退休了，密尼接替了他的职位。密尼继续与每个人融洽相处。他向下属传达每一个领导的建议。决策上的冲突，计划的不断变更很快使部门士气受挫。市长和其他官员、纳税人和维修工人协会都怨声载道。维修部门经常超出预算，却无法完成工作目标。
密尼仍旧对每个人说着“是”，并且在上级和下属之间传递着信息。


Lesson43 American Homes
Many young Americans do not live with their families, but in apartment blocks or residential areas where everyone is more or less of the same age.
Young people often move away from home when they leave school into shared apartments or smaller apartments. They do their own cooking and cleaning, and go to the family home perhaps for the weekend.
Young married couples may move to new suburbs where most people have young families. In the country, some even build their houses themselves.
If a family's income goes up, they often move to another suburb, where the houses are bigger, with two or even three garages, a swimming pool, a games room for the children, and everything a family could want.
Old people often do not live with their grown up children. 
Many live in old people's homes. Some live in special towns, built for old people, where there are no young children and the atmosphere is quiet.
Americans are always on the move, and some families change their homes every few years. Every year, 20% of Americans move house. Mr. and Mrs. Schultz could start life in an apartment in New York, go on to a white painted wooden home in New England, with small windows to keep out the cold in winter, and end their life in a sunny house in California, where oranges grow in the garden, and big windows give a wonderful view of the swimming pool and the sea.

residential 住宅的，与居住有关的

美国家庭
很多年轻的美国人不和自己的家人住在一起，而是住在和自己年龄相仿的人聚集的公寓区或住宅区。
年轻人离开学校后，就从家里搬到合租的公寓或小一点的公寓。他们自己做饭，打扫房间，可能回家度周末。
年轻的新婚夫妇可能会搬到新人聚集的新开发的郊区居住。在乡村，不少人甚至自己盖房子。
家庭收入增加后，他们常搬到其他郊区，那里的房子更大些，有两到三个车库，带泳池、儿童游戏室，具备一切家庭需要的设施。
老人通常不与他们的成年子女住在一起。许多老人住在老年之家里。有些老人住在专为老年人修建的小镇上，那里没有小孩，非常安静。
美国人总是在搬家，一些家庭隔几年就会搬一次。每年有百分之二十的美国人改变居所。舒尔兹夫妇可能在纽约的公寓里开始他们的婚姻生活。继而搬到新英格兰一幢白色的小木屋中，窗户很小，这是为了抵御冬日的严寒。最后在佛吉尼亚阳光灿烂的家中安享晚年，这里的花园栽有柑桔，宽敞的窗外就是泳池和大海的美景。


Lesson44 A Neapolitan Fisherman
The Neapolitan fisherman asleep in the afternoon sun was approached by a well-to-do businessman from another city.
"Why are you asleep instead of doing something useful?"
"What should I do?" answered the fisherman.
"You could mend your nets," suggested the businessman, "and then you would catch more fish. If you caught more fish you would make more money and sooner or later you could afford a bigger fishing boast which would enable you to catch still more fish. In time you could become the owner of several boats and employ other fishermen to work for you. Eventually you would become a wealthy man with a fleet of fishing boats bringing ashore great quantities of fish and earning more than enough money for you and your family to live in great style. 
You would no longer need to work hard or worry about the future. In fact, you'd have la dolce vita. Come on! Wake up! 
The day is short but there's still time to attain your ambition."
The fisherman listened patiently — he had enjoyed a long lunch and felt quite drowsy in the warm afternoon sun — and when the man was finished， the fisherman looked at him puzzled: "I would do all that to have la dolce vita? Why should I do all that to achieve what I already have?"

一个那不勒斯渔民
一个从其他城市来的富商走到一个正在午后阳光下睡觉的那不勒斯渔民身旁。
“你为什么不去做些有用的事而在这里睡觉呢？”
“我应该做什么呢？”渔民回答。
“你可以补网，”商人提议说，“那样你就可以捕到更多的鱼。如果你捕到更多的鱼，你就可以赚更多的钱，迟早你将会拥有更大的渔船，它能让你捕到更多的鱼。你就可以拥有几条船，雇佣其他渔民为你工作。最终，你将成为富人，拥有更多的渔船，这些船会把大量的鱼带上岸，为你赚大量的钱，你的家人将过上幸福的生活。你再也不必努力工作或为将来担心。事实上，你将过上奢华的生活。快点，清醒清醒吧！时不我待，你还来得及实现你的抱负。”
渔民耐心地听着——午餐的时间已经够长了，在暖和的午后阳光下他感到昏昏欲睡——等商人说完，他困惑地看着商人说：“我一定要做所有这些事才能得到奢华的生活吗？我为什么要做那么多去获得我本来已经拥有的生活呢？”


Lesson45 Stately Homes
It was believed that in the old days the rich were very rich and the poor were very poor. Is it really different now? Some of the aristocratic families of Britain still have a lot of money, and some still live in magnificent #stately homes# built by their families hundreds of years ago.
Castles with strong walls and towers may be almost a thousand years old, but most stately homes date from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and many are filled with wonderful collections of paintings and furniture. Even for the richest, life in these old houses is expensive. There are roofs to repair, hundreds of rooms to clean, and miles of parkland to look after. To make money, owners of stately homes often make their parks into playgrounds. They set up zoos, safari parks, model railways, and small museums — anything that people will pay to see.
Not everyone is lucky enough to keep their old home. Many of the people who once owned the castles and palaces of Britain cannot afford to look after them now. Luckily, the buildings still stand, full of wonderful antiques and art treasures.
A large number of them now belong to the National Trust, a private organization which buys historic buildings. The old owners often still live there, and keep the atmosphere of a beautiful private home, but the houses are open to the public too. In this way everyone can enjoy the great cultural treasures of the past.

aristocratic 贵族的    castle 城堡   antique 古物，古董

豪华宅第
人们认为，旧时富人特别富裕，而穷人极其贫困。现在的情形是否不同了呢？英国的一些贵族家庭仍然拥有巨额财富，住在其家族几百年前建造的富丽堂皇的豪宅里。
那些有着坚固的城墙和塔楼的城堡或许有上千年的历史，但大多数宅第的历史追溯至十七、十八世纪，且收藏了大量精美的绘画和家具。即使对于最富有的人来说，在这些旧式豪宅中生活，开销也很庞大。屋顶要修缮，成百个房间要清扫，还有数英里的庭院需要打理。为了挣钱，豪宅主人常常把自己的庄园改造成游艺场。他们建造了动物园、野生动物园、模型铁路以及小型博物馆等等——任何人们愿意花钱观看的东西。
并不是每个拥有旧式豪宅的人都能幸运地保留住他们的老房子。许多曾经拥有城堡和宅邸的人，现在已无力照管它们。幸运的是，建筑依在，里面满是令人称奇的古董和艺术珍宝。
大多数建筑现归属于国民托管组织，这是一个购买历史建筑的私人组织。原来的主人通常还住在房子里，并保持美妙的私人家庭生活氛围，但住宅同时向公众开放。这样人人都可领略伟大的历史文化财富。


Lesson46 A Nicer Father
Charlie Yates was seventeen years old, and although he had left school, he preferred living in his parents' house. He wanted to find a job, but he never seemed to get one. His father wanted him to leave home, but his mother wanted him to stay.
Charlie did not wash his hair very often, he shaved once a week, and he could not stand wearing shoes, so his feet were always dirty.
Mr. Yates sometimes saw his son at weekends, and then he was always angry with him. He used to say to him: "Why don't you shave everyday? Who would give you a job with your dirty hair?" and so on. "But Father,'" Charlie always said, "I don't care about those things."
One Saturday morning, while Charlie and his father were having their usual argument his father said to him, "You should be ashamed to live like that. I was brought up quite differently. 
When I was seventeen, I was forbidden to stay out till three o'clock in the morning, and walk about the house with dirty feet, and grow a beard, and wear gold chains and behave like a ..."
He went on and on until Charlie said kindly, "Poor Father. My grandfather died before I was born, so I never met him, but he must have been a terrible old gentleman."
"Not at all!" Mr. Yates objected angrily. "I had a much nicer father than you'll ever have!"

查理十七岁了。尽管已经从学校毕业，他还是赖在父母的房子里。他想找份工作，但好像从没找到。他的父亲想让他搬出去，但他的母亲想让他留下来。
查理&#8226;亚特不经常洗头，一周刮一次脸，而且他不能忍受穿鞋，所以脚总是很脏。
亚特先生有时在周末看到儿子，然后他总是对儿子很生气。他常常说：“你干吗不天天刮脸？头发那么脏，谁会雇你干活儿？”如此这般。
“可是父亲，”查理总是回答，“我不在乎那些。”
一个周六的早晨，在查理和父亲惯常的争论中，他的父亲说：“你应该为自己的生活感到羞耻。我受到的教养完全不同。当我十七岁时，不许在外呆到凌晨三点，不许脏脚四处走动，不许留胡子，不许戴金项链，不许举止像个……”
他喋喋不休，直到查理很同情地说：“可怜的父亲。祖父在我出生前就去世了，所以也没见过他，但他肯定是个讨厌的老头子。”
“才不是呢！”亚特先生怒气冲冲的反驳，“我的父亲比你的父亲好得多！”


Lesson47 Pubs
Pubs are an important part of life in Britain. People go to the pub to relax, meet friends and sometimes to do business.
Pubs are not open to everyone, and they are not open all the time. People under the age of 14 cannot go into pubs. They are only open from about 11 am ("opening time") until 2:30 pm, and 5:30 pm until 10:30 or 11 pm ('closing time'). When it's closing time, the barman calls 'Time!' or 'Time, gentlemen, please!', although new laws mean that pubs with a special license can open whenever they want.
You can buy most kinds of drink in a pub: beer, lager, all kinds of wine, spirits, liqueurs, fruit juice and soft drinks. 
Beer is the most popular drink, and there are many different kinds. You ask for beer by the 'pint' (a little more than half a litre) or the 'half pint'. When people buy beer they ask for 'bitter' (strong beer), 'mild' (less strong), or lager.
Some people just say the name of the maker:' A half of Double Diamond, please.' or 'Two halves of Export, please.'
Most pubs do not sell hot drinks, like coffee or tea, but many sell hot and cold food. Pub food (called 'pub grub') is often good, is cheaper than most restaurant food, and you don't have to leave a tip, but you do have to go to the bar to get your food and drink. There are no waiters in pubs traditionally, although now more pubs are starting to open small dining rooms which families can use too.

barman 酒吧间招待员   liqueur 利口酒

酒吧
英国人生活中很重要的一部分是泡吧。人们到酒吧放松，和朋友聚会，有时是谈生意。
酒吧并不是对所有人都开放，而且也不是全天营业。不满十四岁的人不能到酒吧。酒吧营业时间大约为上午十一点（开始营业）到下午两点半和下午五点半到晚上十点半或十一点（结束营业）。酒吧关门时，酒保就会吆喝：“时间到了！”或“先生，时间到了！”，虽然新法律规定，有特别许可的酒吧可以想开到几点就开到几点。
在酒吧你能买到绝大多数的饮料：啤酒、贮藏啤酒.、各种红酒、烈酒、利口酒、果汁和软饮料。啤酒是最受欢迎的饮品，且有很多品种，以“品脱”（略多于半升）或“半品脱”为计量单位购买。买啤酒时，人们会点“苦啤酒”（味道浓的啤酒）、“麦芽啤酒”（味道稍淡）或贮藏啤酒。
有些人只说生产商的名字：“请来半瓶Double Diamond”或“请来两个半瓶Export”。
酒吧大多不售热饮，如咖啡或茶，但很多也卖热餐，冷餐。酒吧的食物（称为“酒吧小食”）味道通常不错，价格比大多数餐馆便宜，而且你不用付小费，但你必须到吧台取你的食物和饮料。酒吧传统上没有侍应生，但是现在越来越多的酒吧开始提供也适于家庭使用的小餐厅。


Lesson48 A New Hairdresser's Job
Mathew lived in a big city, and always had his hair cut by the same hairdresser. Mathew went to him once a month. He always cut Mathew's hair exactly as Mathew liked it, and while he was doing it, the two men would talk about their favourite games or movies.
But one day the old hairdresser said to him, 'Mathew, I'm going to be sixty-five years old next month, so I'm going to retire. I'm going to sell my shop to a young man who wants to be a hairdresser.'
Mathew was very sad to hear this, because he enjoyed talking to the old man, and he was also worried that his hair would not be cut as well by the new gentleman.
He went to the shop again next month, and the new man was there. He did a very bad job when he cut Mathew's hair.
Next month, Mathew went into the shop again. The young man asked him how he would like his hair cut, and Mathew answered, 'Please cut it very short on the right side, but leave it as it is on the left. It must cover my ear. On top, cut all the hair away in the middle, but leave a piece at the front which can hang down to my chin.'
The young man was very surprised when he heard this. 'But sir,' he said, 'I can't cut your hair like that!'
'Why not?' Mathew asked. 'That's how you cut it last time.'

hairdresser 理发师

新理发师的手艺
马修住在一个大城市里，一直让同一个理发师理发。马修一个月到他那儿理一次发，他总能把头发理成马修想要的样子，理发师理发时，两个男人就谈着他们喜爱的游戏或电影。
一天，老理发师对马修说：“马修，下个月我就六十五岁了，到时要退休了。我打算把店卖给一个想做理发师的年轻人。”
听到这个消息马修很失落，因为他喜欢和老理发师聊天，而且他担心新理发师理不好。
过了一个月，他又去理发。店里已经换了新的理发师，他给马修理的头发很难看。
一个月后，马修又到了这家店。年轻的理发师问马修想理什么发型，马修说：“麻烦把右侧头发理得短短的，左侧不要动。要能遮住耳朵。头顶中间的头发剪掉，但前面留一绺能垂到下巴的头发。”
年轻人听到他这么说非常吃惊。“可是先生，”他说，“我不能把你的头发理成那个样子！”
“怎么不行？”马修说，“你上次给我理的就是那样。”


Lesson49 This is the USA
The United States of America — the richest and one of the biggest countries in the world — has several names. People call it "the United states", "the States", "America", or just "the USA" or "the US".
There are fifty states in the USA (including Hawaii) with a population of over 200 million. There is no "American climate" or "American countryside". Every part of the country is different, from Alaska in the north, covered with snow and ice, to tropical Florida in the south.
Who are the Americans? Where did they come from? Why did so many people go across the sea to the New World?
The American Indians were the first people to live in this vast land. They had a fascinating ancient culture, and a rich tradition of language and customs. When Christopher Columbus arrived, in 1492, there were probably about 1,500,000 Indians in North America. Then, the immigrants came. By the early nineteenth century, the immigrant population was more than 17 million. Most came from Europe, but there were also many from the Middle East and the Far East, as well as millions of Africans, caught in the terrible slave trade.
Immigration continued. In 1907 alone, one and a quarter million people arrived. By 1914, the population was 92 million. Now there are more than 25 million British Americans (nearly half the population of Britain), about 23 million African Americans, 25 million German Americans and more Irish Americans than the whole population of Ireland.


Lesson50 The Land of Dreams
In the 1840's, California was almost uninhabited. There were a few Spanish missions, some ranchers and farmers, and of course, bandits who stole anything they could find.
In 1848, everything changed. Gold was discovered, and people from all over the country rushed to California. They all dreamed of making their fortunes by finding gold. Mining towns were built anywhere gold was found. As a rule, these towns had no more than a saloon, a hotel, a stable, a jail — and a cemetery.
Almost a century later people again rushed to California. This time, they dreamed of making their fortunes not in gold, but in the movies. Los Angeles, a large city that was not even there in 1848, had become the movie capital of the world. 
These were the days of the great movie stars — actors and actresses like Cary Grant and Rita Hayworth — heroes and heroines like John Wayne and Susan Hayward. Thousands of would-be stars dreamed of being a Hollywood prince or princess.
Few people look for gold now, and Los Angeles is no longer a movie city. It's a factory town where time is money and TV companies control the time. The California scenery has changed, too. A century or so ago there were unclimbed, snow-topped mountains, uninhabited deserts, and unspoiled beaches with high surf. The scenery is still there, but so are thousands of miles of highways, millions of cars, dozens of suburbs — and smog. Most films are now made inside, and the best place to find gold is in a jewelry store.

uninhabited 无人居住的    rancher 牧场主   bandit 强盗
saloon 酒吧   cemetery 墓地

梦想的土地
十九世纪四十年代，加利福尼亚几乎是个不毛之地。那里只有几个西班牙传教士、一些牧场主和农民，当然还有强盗，他们偷窃一切他们所能找到的东西。
1848年，一切都变了。人们在这里发现了黄金，全国各地的人涌向加利福尼亚。他们都梦想可以找到黄金发财。只要哪儿找到黄金，哪儿就立刻出现一个小镇，并且无一例外，这些小镇不过是一个酒吧，一个客栈，一个马厩，一座牢房和一块墓地而已。
大约一个世纪以后，人们再次涌向加利福尼亚。这次，他们不是梦想通过黄金而是通过电影发财。在一八四八年还不存在的洛杉矶现在已经成为了世界电影中心。这是电影明星辈出的时代——像卡里&#8226;格莱特和丽塔&#8226;海华斯那样的男女演员——像约翰&#8226;韦恩和苏珊&#8226;海沃德那样的男女主人公。成千上万的未来明星们梦想成为好莱坞的王子或公主。
现在没人再来找黄金了，洛杉矶也不再是一个电影城市了，它成为了一个工业城市，在那里时间就是金钱，电视公司控制着一切。加利福尼亚的景象也已经完全改变了。大约一个世纪前，那里有未经攀登、山顶积雪覆盖的山脉，无人居住的沙漠和未经破坏的海浪拍打着的海滩。如今，自然景物仍在，但也出现了数千公里的高速公路，数百万的汽车，大片大片的郊区——和烟雾。如今的电影大多都在室内拍摄，能找到黄金的最好的地方是在珠宝商店里。


tropical 热带(地区)的   immigrant 移民

这就是美国
美利坚合众国是世界上最为富有的国家和国土面积最大的国家之一，它拥有好几个名称。人们称之为“美利坚合众国”、“美国”、“USA”或“US”。
美国有五十个州（包括夏威夷），两亿多人口。没有什么“美国式气候”或“美国式乡村”，因为从北端冰雪覆盖的阿拉斯加，到南端炎热潮湿的佛罗里达，美国的每一个地方都不一样。
美国人什么样的人？他们从哪里来？为什么那么多的人漂洋过海来到这个新大陆？
美洲印第安人是这片广阔大陆上的最早居民。他们有令人着迷的古老文明和积淀深厚的语言及习俗的传统。克里斯托夫&#8226;哥伦布一四九二年到达北美时，那里大约有一百五十万印第安人。然后，有移民来到北美。十九世纪早期，移民人口已超过一千七百万，他们大多来自欧洲，也有许多来自中东和远东，还有罪恶的奴隶贸易带来的几百万非洲黑人。
移民潮持续着，仅一九零七年一年，就涌入一百二十五万人。到一九一四年，美国人口达到了九千两百万。现在，超过两千五百万的美国人是英国移民后代（几乎是英国人口的一半），非洲裔美国人大约两千三百万，德裔美国人两千五百万，还有数量超过爱尔兰总人口的爱尔兰裔美国人。


Lesson51 Best Medicine
Jim worked in the office of a big company. He lived alone in a small comfortable apartment with two rooms, a kitchen and a bathroom.
At first he cleaned his apartment himself, but he soon found that he was not able to do housekeeping because he was often too busy. So he hired an old lady called Mrs. Roper to do the cleaning for him. Mrs. Roper accepted the employment with pleasure because she thought that was the right job for her.
After she had been working for Jim for two weeks, Jim looked at the mirror in his bedroom and found that mirror was covered by a thick layer of dust. As a polite young man, he did not want to order Mrs. Roper around, so he wrote a message on the mirror with his finger "I'm coughing these days in this apartment because I have breathed in too much dust."
He came home late that evening. He went into his bedroom and looked at the mirror. "Mrs. Roper didn't seem to have cleaned the room." He said to himself. But then he bent down and saw a bottle in front of the mirror. "I didn't put that bottle there," he thought. "Mrs. Roper must have left it here. He picked the bottle up and looked at it carefully.
"She's written some message for me," he said to himself. It said, "This is the best medicine for your cough."

良药
吉姆在一家大公司的办公室工作。他独自住一套两屋、一厨、一卫的公寓。
起初他自己打扫住处，但很快发现因常常工作忙碌而没有时间做卫生。因此他雇了一个叫做罗珀夫人的老太太给自己打扫房间。罗珀夫人愉快的接受了这份工作，因为她认为这是适合自己的工作。
她工作两周后，吉姆在卧室照镜子时发现镜子上有厚厚的一层灰。作为一个有礼貌的年轻人，他不想当面对她发号施令，因此用手指头在镜子上写了个留言：“这些天我一直咳嗽，因为吸入了太多灰尘。”
当晚他很晚才回家，然后进卧室查看镜子。“看来罗珀夫人没有打扫过房间，”他心里说道，但当弯下腰时他看到镜子前有个瓶子，“我没把瓶子放这儿，”他想，“准是罗珀夫人落下的瓶子。”他把它拾起来，又仔细看了看。
“她给我留言了，”他心想。瓶子上写着：“这是治疗咳嗽最有效的药。”


Lesson52 A Lesson of Life
Mrs. Hammond was old and blind, but she was very independent and tried to do things by herself. She would go for long walks alone once a day and was able to find her way back by using her guiding stick. She had never lost her way until this day.
This day when she was out for a walk, she found the trees on her paths missing because some villagers had cut them down. So she couldn't find her way back. Before she knew what to do, she heard the sound of water near her feet. "Water?" she said aloud to herself. "I must be on a bridge. I"ve been told that there's a river nearby, but I'm not familiar with its exact position. How can I get back from here?"
At once she heard a man's friendly voice near her. It said "excuse me, can I help you?
"How kind of you! Mrs. Hammond answered. "Yes, please. I'm afraid I've got lost. Can you please help me get home?
"Certainly," the man answered. And they began walking. The man took Mrs. Hammond to her house, and she invited him in and told the man how grateful she was that she had met him.
"Don't thank me," he answered. "I want to thank you."
"Thank me?" Mrs. Hammond said. "What for?"
"Well," the man answered, "I was trying to throw myself into 
the river and drown myself. But I'm not going to do it now."

生命的教训
哈蒙德夫人又老又盲，但她很独立，尽量自己做事。她每天都要独自到较远的地方散步一次，因为有导路棍，所以能找回家。她从未迷过路，直到有一天。
这天哈蒙德夫人出去散步，因为村民砍倒了她每天走的小路上的树，她发现树不见了。这下她找不回去了。就在不知道该怎么办时，她听见脚边有流水声。“有水？”她大声嘀咕。“我准是在桥上，别人告诉过我附近有条小河，可我并不知道它的准确位置。这可怎么回去呢？”
立刻一个男人友善的声音在她耳边响起：“需要帮忙吗？”
“您真好！”哈蒙德夫人答道。“是的，谢谢。我怕是迷路了。您能帮我回到家吗？”
“没问题，”男子说。然后他们开始走，男子把哈蒙德夫人送到家门口，哈蒙德夫人邀他进屋，并说她非常高兴遇到他。
“别谢我，”男子说道，“我要谢谢你。”
“谢我？”哈蒙德夫人问，“为什么谢我？”
“嗯，”男子说，“我刚才正要跳河自溺，但现在不想了。”


Lesson53 New York
Everyone has an image of New York — the Statue of Liberty, the skyscrapers,the beautiful shops on Fifth Avenue,or the Broadway theatres. This is America's cultural capital, and her biggest city, with a population of nearly eight million. In the summer it is hot, hot, and hot and in the winter it can be very cold.
There are five "boroughs" in New York: Brooklyn, the Bronx, Manhattan, Queens and Richmond. Only one of them, the Bronx, is not on an island.
Manhattan, the smallest island in New York, is the real centre of the city. When people say "New York City" they usually mean Manhattan. Most of the interesting shops, buildings and museums are here, and Manhattan is the scene of New York's busy night life.
In 1605 the first Europeans came to Manhattan from Holland. 
They bought the island from the American Indians for a few glass necklaces, worth about $26 today.
Wall Street in Manhattan is the financial heart of the USA and the most important banking centre in the world.
Like every big city, New York has its own traffic system. 
Traffic jams can be terrible, and it's usually quickest to go by subway. The New York subway is easy to use and quite cheap. 
Take a look at the map. The subway goes to almost every corner of Manhattan. But be careful. It's better not to go by subway late at night.

borough 区

纽约
每个人的脑子里都有一个纽约的形象——自由女神、摩天大楼、第五大道上的漂亮小店，或是百老汇的剧院。纽约是美国的文化中心、最大的城市，人口超过八百万。这里夏季酷热，冬季却又非常寒冷。
纽约有布鲁克林、布朗克斯、曼哈顿、皇后和里士满五个区，其中只有布朗克斯区不在岛上。
纽约最小的岛——曼哈顿，是纽约市真正的中心。人们说“纽约市”时，通常是指曼哈顿，好多吸引人的店铺、建筑和博物馆坐落于此，而纽约热闹的夜生活也在此上演。
一六零五年，第一批欧洲人从荷兰出发来到曼哈顿，他们用今日市值二十六美元的几串玻璃项链从美洲印第安人手中买下了这个岛屿。
位于曼哈顿的华尔街是美国的金融中心，也是世界最重要的银行业中心。
一如其他的大城市，纽约有着自己的交通系统。这里会有严重的交通拥堵，通常最快捷的出行方式是乘坐地铁。纽约的地铁很便利也很便宜，看看地图就知道，乘坐地铁可至曼哈顿的每一个角落。但是注意，深夜最好不要乘坐地铁。



Lesson54 A Necklace
Helen and Mary are both studying English at University. Helen is very good at throwing the javelin and Mary is very good at running.
One evening they went to practice their sports in the university grounds, and when they had finished, they walked part of the way home together, but at one corner they had to say goodbye because their homes were in different directions.
"Be careful on your way home," Mary said to Helen. "I would be happier if your houses were nearer."
"Me too," answered Helen.
The next morning Helen and Mary met at an English class, and Helen said to Mary, "Do you know what happened to me after I left you yesterday evening?"
"No, " answered Mary anxiously. "What happened to you?"
"Well," Helen said, "a thief came up behind me and robbed me of my necklace."
"I wish I"d been there," Mary said angrily. "I"d have run after the man and I"d probably have caught him. But what are you going to do now? Have you been to the police?"
"No," Helen answered with a smile.
"Why not?" Mary asked in surprise.
"Because," Helen answered, "when the man pulled my necklace, I turned round suddenly and put my hand out to try to stop him. 
I caught his necklace and pulled it off him. My necklace was a cheap one which was not real silver; but his is made of real gold! If I went to the police, I might have to give it to him."

Javelin （投掷用的）标枪

一条项链
海伦和玛丽都在大学学习英语。海伦很擅长标枪，玛丽则长于跑步。
有天晚上，两人到学校操场练习标枪和跑步，练完后他们一起走一段路回家，但是在一个拐弯处两人必须分手了，因为两家不在同一方向。
“路上小心”，玛丽对海伦说，“如果你家更近些我会更开心的。”
“我也是，”海伦说。
第二天早上，海伦和玛丽在英语课上见面了，海伦跟玛丽说：“知道昨晚你走后，我碰到什么事吗？”
“不知道，”玛丽着急地问，“出了什么事？”
“唉，”海伦说，“一个小偷从我背后窜出来，抢了我的项链。”
“当时我要在那儿多好，”玛丽生气的说，“我跑步追他，或许能逮着他。但你现在准备怎么办？报警了吗？”
“没有，”海伦笑着回答。
“为什么不去？”玛丽惊奇地问。
“因为，”海伦说，“小偷拽我项链的时候，我突然转身，伸出手想阻止他，结果抓住了他的项链并揪了下来。我的项链不是真银的，不值钱，可他的却是货真价实的金项链！如果我报了警，项链就得还给他。”


Lesson55 An Amateur Artist
When Sebastian was at school, his favourite lesson was art, and he won several prizes because he was so good at painting. 
Once he left school, he got a position as a clerk in a bank, but three times a week he went to evening classes in art, and whenever he had time at the weekends, he painted.
　　After a few months he thought, "Perhaps I can sell some of my pictures and get enough money to leave the bank and become a real artist because I don"t like life at the bank. I only enjoy painting."
　　In the bank, Sebastian sometimes had to deal with a man who owned a picture shop. Sebastian invited him to his home one evening to see some of his work. Sebastian took the man to his studio and started to show him some of his pictures, with some pride and hope.
　　The man looked at them one after another while Sebastian watched his face, but to Sebastian＇s disappointment the man did not say anything, and his expression did not change at any of them either.
　　Then, when he had finished, he looked around, and his glance fell on something else. A happy look came over his face for the first time, and he said, "Now I like this one very much! It's so full of deep feeling! I"m sure I could sell this one for you!"
　"That," said Sebastian "is the place where I clean the paint off my brushes."

amateur 余的    glance  眼光

业余艺术家
塞巴斯蒂安在中学时，他最喜欢的课是艺术课，而且因为画的画相当不错，得过几次奖。一毕业，他就得到一个银行职员的工作，但仍然一周三次去夜校上艺术课，而且只要周末有时间就绘画。
过了几个月，他想：“或许我可以卖掉一些画，挣到足够的钱就离开银行，做一个真正的艺术家，因为我不喜欢银行的工作，只喜爱绘画。”
在银行，塞巴斯蒂安有时处理一个画铺老板的业务，有天晚上，他邀请这个老板到家里看看自己的一些作品。塞巴斯蒂安把老板带到画室，带着自豪和希望向他展示几幅画。
老板一幅接一幅的看画，塞巴斯蒂安则观察着他的脸，但令人失望的是，老板什么也没说，他的表情也没因哪一幅画而改变。
看完后，他四处望望，目光落在了其他地方。脸上第一次有了满意的神情，然后他说：“现在我很喜欢这幅作品！它饱含如此强烈的情感！我保证给你卖出去！”
“那个，”塞巴斯蒂安说：“是我清洁画笔颜料的地方。”


Lesson56 Balance of Nature
All the different plants and animals in a natural world are in a state of balance. This balance is achieved by the plants and animals interacting with each other and with their non-living surroundings. An example of a natural community is woodland, which is usually dominated by a particular species of plant, such as the oak tree in an oak wood. The oak tree in this example is therefore called the dominant species but there are also many other types of plants, such as bushes, small trees, mosses, lichens and algae.
　　The plants of a community use carbon dioxide, oxygen, water and nitrogen to build up their tissues using energy in the form of sunlight. The plant tissues form food for the plant-eating animals which are in turn eaten by the flesh-eating animals. Thus plants produce the basic food supply for all the animals of a community. The animals themselves are the consumers, and are either herbivores or carnivores.
　　Examples of herbivores in a woodland community are rabbits, deer, mice, snails, and insects. The herbivores are sometimes eaten by the carnivores. Woodland carnivores are of all sizes, from insects to animals like owls, and foxes. Some carnivores feed on herbivores, some feed on the smaller carnivores, while some feed on both. These food relationships between the different members of the community are known as food chains or food webs. All food chains start with plants. The links of the chain are formed by the herbivores that eat the plants and the carnivores that feed on the herbivores.

oak [植]橡树，橡木   moss 苔，藓   lichen [植]青苔，地衣，苔藓   algae  藻类，海藻
nitrogen  [化]氮   carnivore 食肉动物    herbivore  草食动物

自然平衡
自然界所有不同的植物和动物都处于平衡状态。这种平衡是通过植物和动物互相作用，以及它们与非生命环境互相影响取得的。例如，林地是一个自然生物群落，它通常由一特定种类的植物所主导，比方说橡树林里的橡树。此例中的橡树因而被称为优势物种，但也有许多其他种类的植物，像灌木、小树、苔藓、地衣和藻类。
植物群落利用二氧化碳、氧气、水和氮生成能吸取阳光能量的组织。植物组织成为食草动物的食物，食肉动物又以食草动物为食。这样植物为生物群落里的所有动物提供了基本的食物。动物自身是取食者，或为食草动物，或为食肉动物。
举例来说，林地生物群落里的草食动物有兔子、鹿、老鼠，蜗牛以及昆虫，它们不时被食肉动物吃掉。林地里的食肉动物有大有小，从昆虫到猫头鹰和狐狸这样的动物。有些食肉动物捕食食草动物，有些吃更小的食肉动物，还有一些两种都吃。生物群落里不同物种间的食物关系称为食物链或食物网。所有的食物链均开始于植物。食物链的链环是以植物为生的食草动物和捕食食草动物的食肉动物。


Lesson57 Family Life
British and American families are small. In fact, the populations of both Britain and the USA have stopped growing. 
The typical family has a father, mother and two children. 
Grandparents come to visit, but do not usually live with their children.
Most people get married between the ages of 20 and 25, but many marriages end in divorce. This means that in both countries there are a large number of "single parent families", one father or mother looking after their children 
alone.
The typical British family has a car, a colour TV set, a washing machine, and a cat or dog as well. They start the day at about 7 o'clock, have breakfast at 8, and are off to work by 8:30. Most women now go out to work as well as men. The children have lunch at school at about 12:30, and come home at 4 in the afternoon. Their parents are usually home by 6 o"clock, and the family eats together. After the dinner the father may go to the pub for a drink, or stay at home and watch TV with the others. Children go to bed early, at about 8 o'clock, two or three hours before their parents.
The typical American family has more money than a British family. Many have two or three cars, large modern kitchens and more electrical goods. They eat more meat and spend more on clothes, but their daily program is nearly the same. Like British children, American children eat lunch at school, come home mid-afternoon, and go to bed earlier than their parents.

家庭生活
英美两国的家庭规模都不大。事实上，英美两国的人口已经停止增长。一个典型的家庭有父亲、母亲和两个孩子。祖父母会到自己孩子家中逗留做客，但通常不会和他们长期住在一起。
大多数人在二十岁到二十五岁之间结婚，但很多婚姻以离婚收场。这意味着两国有大量的“单亲家庭”，父亲或母亲单独抚养孩子。
典型的英国家庭有一辆车、一台彩电、一台洗衣机，还有一只猫或狗。他们早晨七点起床，八点吃早饭，八点半前离家外出工作。如今大多数妇女和男人一样出去工作。孩子十二点半在校吃中饭，下午四点回家。父母通常晚上六点到家，然后一家人一起吃晚饭。饭后，父亲或到酒吧喝酒，或在家和家人一起看电视。孩子们睡得早，大约八点就休息了，比父母早两到三个小时。
典型的美国家庭比英国家庭有钱，他们大多有两到三部车，有宽敞的现代化厨房和更多的电器。美国家庭虽然比英国家庭吃肉多，在穿衣上花钱多，但两国家庭的日常生活几乎是相同的。和英国孩子一样，美国孩子在学校吃午饭，下午三四点回家，早于父母上床睡觉。


Lesson58 A Sunset on the Screen
The director of a film planned to film a beautiful sunset over the ocean. He sent his camera crew out one evening to shot the sunset for him.
The next morning he said to the men, "Have you got that sunset?"
"No, sir," the men answered.
"Why not?" he asked.
"Well, sir," one of the men answered, "we're on the east coast here, and the sun sets in the west. We can get you a sunrise over the sea, if necessary, but not a sunset."
"But I want a sunset!" the director shouted. "Go to the airport take the next flight to the west coast, and get one."
But then a young secretary had an idea. "Why don't you photograph a sunrise," she suggested, "and then put it through the projector backwards? Then it'll look like a sunset."
"That's a very good idea!" the director said. Then he turned to the camera crew and said, "Tomorrow morning I want you to get me a beautiful sunrise over the sea.
The camera crew went out early the next morning and filmed a bright sunrise over the beach in the middle of a beautiful bay. Then at nine o'clock they took it to the director. "Here it is, sir," they said, and showed it to him. He liked it very much.
They all went into the studio. "All right, now run the film backwards through the projector." Said the director.
The "sunset" began, but after a quarter of a minute, the director suddenly shouted to the camera crew to stop.
The birds in the film were flying backwards, and the waves on the sea were going away from the beach.

镜头里的日落
一个电影导演计划拍摄美丽的海上落日。有天傍晚，他派摄像组出去为他拍日落。
次日早晨，他问他们：“你们拍到日落没？”
“没有，先生，”摄像组的人说。
“为什么没拍到？”导演问。
“是这样的，先生，”其中一个人说，“我们这里是东海岸，而太阳在西边落下。需要的话，我们能为您拍到海上日出，但日落不行。”
“可我要日落！”导演嚷嚷，“到机场搭下一个到西岸去的航班，然后拍个日落。”
这时一个年轻秘书想出个办法。“你们为什么不拍个日出，”她建议，“然后用放映机回放？这样看起来就是日落了。”
“好主意！”导演说。然后他转向摄像组说：“明天早晨我要你们给我拿来美丽的海上日出。”
摄像组第二天一大早就出去了，在一个漂亮的海湾中间拍摄到了光芒四射的海滨日出。九点时他们拿给导演。“拍好了，先生，”他们把片子递给导演，导演非常高兴。
导演和摄像组的人进了工作室。“好，现在回放片子看看。”导演说。
“日落”开始了，刚过了十五秒，导演突然冲摄像组大声叫停。
影片里的鸟儿在倒着飞，而海浪在从海滩冲向大海。


Lesson59 Restaurants in London
British restaurants are not, unfortunately, famous for their good food. Too often, they offer only sausages and chips, fish and chips — chips with everything in fact, but there are some wonderful surprises in British cooking; especially the many delicious cakes and desserts. The British certainly enjoy their food. There's a fantastic variety of restaurants of all nationalities in London.
Most British families only go to restaurants on special occasions, like birthdays, or wedding anniversaries. The restaurants" best customers are businessmen, who meet in them to talk business in a relaxed atmosphere away from the telephone. They can eat what they like, because the company pays the bill! When a boy and girl want to get to know each other better, they often go out to a restaurant together. 
After all, it"s easier to talk in a quiet atmosphere, with soft music, wine and good food.
For visitors to London, eating out can be fun. You can have the chance to go to places where the traditional menu and décor are just like they were in Queen Victoria"s day, a hundred years ago. Or you can take a walk down the King"s road in Chelsea where there are dozens of small restaurants.
If you want that special London feeling, go to the Ritz in Piccadilly for tea any afternoon at about half past four. Too expensive? Then try England's favourite food — fish and chips. 
Take it away and eat it where you like — in the park, on the bus, or while you walk down the street. That's what Londoners do!

décor 装饰，装饰风格

伦敦的餐馆 
遗憾的是，伦敦的餐馆并不以美味的食品扬名。餐馆常常仅供应香肠和炸土豆条、炸鱼片和炸土豆条——事实上，任何东西都会配有炸土豆条。不过，英国也有一些令人惊喜的美食，尤其有很多别具风味的蛋糕和甜点。英国人当然乐于享用自己的食品，伦敦有众多不同民族风味的餐馆。 
大多数英国家庭仅在像生日或结婚周年纪念日等特殊的日子里才去餐馆用餐。最受餐馆青睐的顾客是商人，他们可在免受电话干扰的轻松气氛中谈生意。因为是公司买单，他们尽可以点自己喜欢吃的东西。当男女青年想要深入地了解对方，他们通常一起去餐馆用餐。毕竟在一个有着轻柔的音乐、美酒和佳肴的静谧气氛中，人们更容易打开心扉。 
对到伦敦观光的人来说，在外用餐是充满乐趣的。你可以到那些保留着一百多年前维多利亚时期的旧式菜单和装饰风格的餐馆用餐，或者可沿着切尔西区的国王大道漫步，那里聚集了许多小餐馆。 
如果你要享受特别的伦敦风情，可在下午的四点半左右到皮卡迪利大街的里兹饭店享用下午茶。太奢侈吗？那就尝尝英国人最喜爱的炸鱼片和炸土豆条吧！你可以带走，想在哪儿吃就在哪儿吃——公园里，巴士上，或者沿街闲逛的时候。伦敦人就是这么吃的！


Lesson60 The Dishonest Desk Clerk
About a year ago, I registered at a Detroit hotel. I had just cashed a check. I didn't want to carry too much money with me, so I asked the desk clerk to put a hundred-dollar bill in the safe for me.
The next morning the clerk denied any knowledge of my money. I had neither a receipt nor any other proof that I had given the man my money. It was his word against mine. There was nothing I could do but go to the nearest lawyer.
The lawyer advised me to return to the hotel with him and give another hundred-dollar bill to the clerk. This we did. An hour later I went back to the desk and claimed my money. Since I had the lawyer as an eyewitness to the second hundred-dollar bill, the clerk could not look innocent and say he knew nothing about it.
Another hour later, I put the second part of the lawyer"s plan into action. This time both the lawyer and I went to the hotel. I asked for the hundred-dollar bill, and then the clerk insisted he had already given it to me, I denied it. The lawyer said, "I saw this man give you a hundred dollars. If you don't hand it over immediately, I'll be forced to call the police." The clerk realized he had been tricked, but he knew he had to face the music. He gave me back the first hundred-dollar bill.
"I don't know how to thank you for getting my money back," I said to the lawyer. And what do you suppose he answered?
The lawyer said, "Oh, don"t thank me. That will be a hundred dollars please."

不诚实的前台接待员
大约一年前，我住进了底特律的一家旅馆。我刚刚兑现了一张支票，但我不想带太多的现金在身边，所以我让前台接待员帮我把一百美元放在保险箱里。
第二天早上，前台服务员说没帮我保管钱。我既没有收据也没有其他任何凭据可以证明我给了那人钱。我们俩人各说各说的。我没有办法只能去了最近的律师所。
律师建议我和他一起回旅馆，再给接待人员一张一百美元。我们就这样做了。一小时以后，我回到前台，索要我的钱。因为这次我有律师做目击证人，证明我给过那位前台服务员这第二张一百美元，他不能装无辜说不知道这件事。
又过了一个小时，我实行律师的第二步计划。这次律师和我都去了旅馆。我向那个接待员要一百美元的钞票，他坚持说已经还给我了，但是我不承认。律师说，“我看到这个人给了你一百美元。如果你不立刻把钱还给他，我只好报警了。”接待人员意识到自己中了圈套，但他知道他必须面对现实。他把第一张一百美元还给了我。
“我不知道该如何感谢你帮我讨回了钱，”我对律师说。你猜他是怎么回答我的？
律师说，“哦，不用谢我。你需要支付给我的费用是一百美元。”

Lesson1 Power of Architecture 
Architecture is to be regarded by us with the most serious thought. We may live without her, and worship without her, but we cannot remember without her. How cold is all history, how lifeless all imagery, compared to that which the living nation writes, and the uncorrupted marble bears! --how many pages of doubtful record might we not often spare, for a few stones left one upon another! 
The ambition of the old Babel builders was well directed for this world: there are but two strong conquerors of the forgetfulness of men. Poetry and Architecture; and the latter in some sort includes the former, and is mightier in its reality: it is well to have, not only what men have thought and felt, but what their hands have handled, and their strength wrought, and their eyes behold, all the days of their life. 

Imaginary n. （文学作品中的）意像、形像   behold vt. 看 
wrought vt. (work 的过去式和过去分词 ) 精心制作 

建筑的力量 
我们应该以最严肃认真的态度来看待建筑。没有建筑，我们可以生存，可以崇拜上帝，但是我们就会失去记忆。与现存的民族记录下来的和依然如新的大理石展示给我们的东西相比，历史是那么凄冷，想象力是那么毫无生气。几块垒在一起的石头会给我们省下多少张满是疑点的记录。 
古老的通天塔的建设者们的雄心对这个世界是有很大的指导意义的：只有两样东西能够克服人类的健忘：诗歌和建筑。在某种意义上，建筑包含诗歌，并且事实上比诗歌更具威力：我们不仅可以拥有人在生命的进程中想到和感觉到的东西，还可以拥有人的双手建造的、努力创造的以及看到的东西，这是多么美好呀。


Lesson2 Parent-children relationship by Bertrand Russell 
The value of parental affection to children lies largely in the fact that it is more reliable than any other affection. One's friends like one for one's merits, one's lovers for one's charms; if the merits or the charms diminish, friends and lovers may vanish. But it is in times of misfortune that parents are most to be relied upon, in illness, and even in disgrace if the parents are of the right sort. 
We all feel pleasure when we are admired for our merits, but most of us are sufficiently modest at heart to feel that such admiration is precarious. Our parents love us because we are their children and this is an unalterable fact, so that we feel safer with them than with anyone else. In times of success this may seem unimportant, but in times of failure it affords a consolation and a security not to be found elsewhere. 

precarious adj. 不稳定的 
unalterable adj. 不能变更的 
consolation n. 安慰 , 起安慰作用的人或事物 


父母和子女的关系 
父母对子女的爱比其他任何感情都稳定可靠，在很大程度上这是其价值所在。朋友喜欢我们是因为我们的美德，爱人爱我们是因为我们的魅力。如果这些美德或者魅力减弱了，我们可能会失去朋友和爱人。但是在我们遭遇不幸时，父母是我们最可依赖的。如果遇到好的父母，即使我们声名扫地，也是如此。 
有人敬仰我们的美德时，我们都会感到快乐，但是我们大多数人的内心都知道，这种敬仰是不可靠的。我们的父母爱我们是因为我们是他们的子女，这是不可改变的事实，所以和父母在一起时我们会感到比和其他任何人在一起时都安全。我们功成名就时，这可能显得并不重要。但是在我们失意的时候，父母给予我们的安慰和安全感是通过其他任何途径都无法得到的。



Lesson3 The Computer and Privacy 
In the last 20 years, the productivity of the computer has increased over 1,000%. With this kind of technological advance, the possibility of storing more and more information at a central point is growing at a phenomenal rate. But so is the possibility of gaining access to the stored information. And that raises serious questions regarding personal privacy. For some time now, there has been a growing effort in many European countries to preserve the individual's privacy in the face of expanding requirements for information by business, government and other organizations. 
In some countries, legislation has been enacted to protect the individual's privacy. In others, it is under study. In searching for appropriate legislative guidelines, private and governmental groups have explored many avenues and considered many aspects of the problem. Solutions must be found. And they will call for patient understanding and the best efforts of everyone concerned. 

pledge vt. 保证     legislation n. 立法 

电脑和隐私 
在过去二十年里，电脑生产率的增长超过百分之一千。在这种技术进步的条件下，把越来越多的信息储存在一个中心点的技术已经获得了惊人的发展，同样，访问这些已经储存起来的信息的技术也突飞猛进。这就引出了有关个人隐私的严重问题。 
面对商业、政府和其他组织不断膨胀的对信息的要求，有段时间以来，在许多欧洲国家有一股不断增长的要求保护个人隐私的努力。 
在一些国家，已经立法来保护个人隐私。在其他国家里，这个问题还正在研究中。 
为了寻找合适的立法指导方针，民间和政府团体系统地研究了许多途径，考虑了这个问题的许多方面。 
解决方案必须找到，但这需要人们的宽容和理解，有关的每个人都要尽其最大的努力。


Lesson4 Work
In the laws of political economy, the alienation of the worker from his product is expressed as follow: the more the worker produces, the less he has to consume; the more value he creates, the more valueless, the more unworthy he becomes; the better formed is his product, the more deformed becomes the worker; the more civilized his product, the more brutalized becomes the worker and the more he becomes nature@s bondsman.
Political economy conceals the alienation inherent in labour by avoiding any mention of the evil effects of work on those who work. Thus, whereas labour produces miracles for the rich, for the worker it produces destitution. Labour produces palaces but for the workers, hovels. It produces beauty, but it cripples the worker. It replaces labour by machines, but how does it treat the worker? By throwing some workers back into a barbarous kind of work, and by turning the rest into machines. It produces intelligence, but for the worker, stupidity and cretinism.

alienation 异化   brutalize 使...变得残酷无情   bondsman 奴隶
inherent 固有的, 内在的   hovel 简陋小屋   cretinism ［医］ 呆小病, 愚侏病

劳动 
政治经济学原理对劳动者与自己生产的产品的异化有如下表述：工人产出的越多，消费能力就越小；创造的价值越多，自己就越不值钱，工人的价值就越低；产品的性能越好，工人受损害的程度就越大；产品的文明程度越高，工人就变得越没有感情，越来越成为大自然的奴隶。 
政治经济学没有提到工作对劳动者的有害影响，因而隐藏了劳动具有的内在的异化劳动者的本质特性。这样，虽然劳动为富人创造了奇迹，却给劳动者带来了贫困。劳动建造了宫殿，劳动者却住在简陋小屋里。劳动产生了美丽，却严重损害了劳动者。机器取代了人工劳动，那么劳动者受到了怎样的待遇呢？一些劳动者被迫从事低级繁重的工作，其他的都变成了机器。劳动带来了智慧，带给劳动者的却是愚昧和痴呆。


Lesson5 A Tip for Readers Living Alone
For years my Great Aunt Maud lived alone in a remote cottage beside a road in the Welsh hills. Yet she was never afraid of being attacked or robbed because she had devised a unique way of protecting herself. Hanging in the lobby of her house, and visible from the front door was a policeman's hat. Naturally anyone calling at the house immediately noticed the hat and assumed that there was a policeman living there. Aunt Maud never had any trouble from doorstep dodgers or people calling at the house to try and find out if it was worth burgling. She felt quite safe.
After her death, her cottage was cleared out, and the policeman's hat was packed away in a suitcase and forgotten. Just the other day I came across it, and remembering Aunt Maud's idea, I hung it on a peg in the hall for any caller to see as soon as the door opens. I really feel safe and snug now that it's there!

dodger 骗子   snug 舒服、安全

送给独居读者的建议 
我的莫德姑婆曾独自一人住在威尔士山区路边的一座偏僻房子里多年，但是她从来就不担心被袭击或者被抢劫，因为她设计了一种独特的方式来保护自己。她把一顶警官的帽子挂在房子的门厅里，从前门就可以看到。自然地，拜访这座房子的人立刻就能注意到这顶帽子，就会认为这里住着一位警官。莫德姑婆从来就没有受到门前踩点的歹徒的滋扰，这些人通常会来到房子门口探测这家是否可以盗窃。她感到很安全。 
她去世后，她的房子给清空了，那顶警官帽子被打包装进了手提箱内，被大家遗忘了。几天前，我偶然又看到了这顶帽子，想起了莫德姑婆的方法。我把它挂在大厅里的木栓上，门一开来访者就能看到。有帽子在这儿，我确实感到安全有了保障。


Lesson6 Technological Advances
No one can deny that technology is transforming the way we live at a breathtaking rate. It is hard to believe that only a few years ago the great majority of people were still communicating by letter and traditional telephones. Now e-mail and cell phones are rapidly replacing the old forms of communication. Just around the corner are robot vacuum cleaners and cars which automatically keep a safe distance from the car ahead.
All these technological advances make our lives increasingly more comfortable and convenient. Just as the dishwasher, clothes washer and dryer and microwave oven made life easier and created more leisure time for our parents generation, the technological advances of the future will create an even more leisurely life for the future generation.What worries some people, however, is that the technological devices which are transforming our lives are at the same time leading to less human interaction. In the future people will have to be watchful to prevent technology from diminishing our personal contacts with our fellow human beings.

技术进步
没有人能够否认技术在以惊人的速度改变我们的生活方式。很难相信，仅在几年前大多数人仍在使用信件和传统电话进行通讯。现在电子邮件和移动电话正在迅速取代旧的通讯方式。遥控的真空吸尘器和能够自动与前面汽车保持安全距离的车很快就会出现。
所有这些技术进步使我们的生活日益舒适和便利。正如洗碗机、洗衣机、烘干机和微波炉让我们的父辈生活得更加轻松，创造了更多的空暇时光，未来技术上的进步会为后代带来比现在更安逸的生活。
然而，令许多人担心的是，技术装置在改变我们生活的同时也减少了人与人之间的交往。在将来，人们必须警惕，防止技术减少我们与其他人的交往.


Lesson7 On the Industrialization
The process of industrialization involved the harnessing of inanimate sources of energy, the replacement of handicraft production with machine-based manufacturing, and the generation of new forms of business and labor organization.
Along with industrialization came demographic growth, large-scale migration, and rapid urbanization, which increased the demand for manufactured goods by the masses of working people. Societies that underwent industrialization enjoyed sharp increases in economic productivity: they produced large quantities of high-quality goods at low prices, and their increased productivity translated into higher material standards of living. Yet industrialization brought costs, in the form of unsettling social problems, as well as benefits. Family life changed dramatically in the industrial age as men, women, and children increasingly left their homes to work in factories and mines, often under appalling condition.
Socialist critics sought to bring about a more just and equitable society and government authorities curtailed the worst abuses of the early industrial era. Governments and labor unions both worked to raise living standards and provide security for working people.
Meanwhile, industrialization increasingly touched the lives of peoples around the world. Western European, North American, and Japanese societies followed Britain's lead into industrialization, while many African, Asian, and Latin American land become dependent on the export of raw materials to industrial societies.

inanimate 无生命的；无生气的
demographic 人口的；人口统计学的
urbanization 城市化
curtail 缩短；减缩；限制

论工业化
工业化进程包括利用无生命的能源、以机器生产代替手工业生产以及产生新的商业和劳动组织形式。伴随着工业化会出现人口增长、大规模移民和快速城市化，这加剧了劳动大众对工业制成品的需求。在经历工业化的社会里，经济生产率急速增长：以低廉的价格生产出大量的优质商品，而生产率的增长提高了物质生活水平。然而，在带来福利的同时，工业化也带来了成本，其体现是那些随之产生的令人不安的社会问题。工业化时代的家庭生活发生了急剧的变化，越来越多的男人、女人和儿童离开家园到工厂和矿山工作，他们的工作条件通常极差。社会主义批判家们试图建立一个更公平和平等的社会，政府部门制止了早期工业时代最严重的弊端。政府和工会都努力提高人们的生活水平，为劳动人民提供保障。同时，工业化越来越多地触及到世界各地人们的生活。在英国的带领下，西欧、北美、和日本的社会相继进入了工业化时代，而许多非洲、亚洲，和拉丁美洲的国家依赖于向工业社会出口原材料。


Lesson8 Air Rage
Forty years ago, Americans planning a long trip overwhelmingly chose to travel by car or train, or if going overseas, by ship. Air travel was still a relatively expensive means of transportation favoured by wealthy Americans.
These days air travel is an integral part of the lives of the large majority of travellers in the United States. The cost of an air ticket has not changed much since 1960, while the average American's buying power has increased ten times. Even in the past ten years, air travel by Americans has increased by 37 percent.Unfortunately the construction of new airports and the training of personnel have not kept pace with the demand for more flights. These shortfalls, along with the usual, frequent occurrences of bad weather, have resulted in a large number of delays in both departures and arrivals of airplanes across the country. In fact, delays affected 40 percent of all domestic flights during the past year. These delays have contributed to increased frustration among travellers and outbreaks of violent behaviour during flights, a new phenomenon known as "air rage."

overwhelmingly 压倒性地  shortfall 不足   outbreak 爆发

飞机旅行暴怒症 
四十年前，美国人计划长途旅行的话，绝大多数选择汽车或火车出行，如果出国，则选择船。飞机旅行只是富裕的美国人青睐的一种相对昂贵的交通方式。 
现在飞机旅行成了美国绝大多数出游者生活的不可缺少的一部分。自1960年以来，飞机票的价格没怎么变化，而普通美国人的购买力已经增长了十倍。即使在过去的十年中，坐飞机旅行的美国人增长了百分之三十七。
不幸的是，新机场的建设和机组人员的培训赶不上对航空旅行的需求。这些不足和经常出现的恶劣天气，导致国内飞行中经常发生推迟起飞和延误到达。事实上，去年有百分之四十的国内飞行受到延误的影响。这些延误给旅行者带来越来越多的愤怒和痛苦，导致航空旅行中的暴力行为，这是一种被称之为“飞机旅行暴怒症”的新现象。





Lesson9 Police Life
The average citizen in the United States has very little personal contact with the police. Contacts most frequently occur in two contexts: Americans sometimes approach a policeman to ask for street directions; and police sometimes stop a motorist for speeding or some other traffic violation. Neither of these situations is usually violent or life-threatening.
However, the life of a policeman in a large American city can be both violent and life-threatening almost on a daily basis. This is especially true for police assigned to patrol the poorest sections of the city where most violent crimes take place. Here police routinely come in contact with drug dealers, armed robbers, muggers and the like.
If a policeman is exposed for too long a period of time to these types of people from the lowest level of society, they run the risk of being injured or of developing a prejudice against all the residents of the poor districts of the city. For this reason, the police chief regularly changes policemen's assignments so that they can escape from the tension and danger of patrols in the ghetto. These other assignments might be deskwork or controlling traffic.

patrol 巡逻   mugger 行凶抢劫者   ghetto 少数民族聚居的地区,贫民区

警察生活 
美国普通民众很少与警察有私人接触。大多数接触经常发生在两种情境下：找警察问路时，和因驾车超速或违反其他交通规则被警察拦停时。
通常这些情形都不会有暴力发生，也不会危及生命。 
然而，美国大城市里的警察生活几乎每天都面临暴力和生命危险。对于负责巡逻暴力犯罪多发的城市最贫穷地区的警察来说，尤其如此。这里和警察日常打交道的都是毒品贩子、带武器的抢劫犯、走私犯和诸如此类的人。 
如果一个警察太长时间置身于这类来自社会最底层的人员之中，他们会有受伤或对城市里贫困街区的居民形成偏见的危险。正因如此，警察局长定期调整警察的任务，让他们远离巡逻贫民区的压力和危险。其他任务有可能是文书工作或交通监管。


Lesson10 The Country Maid and Her Milk Can
A country maid was walking along with a can of milk upon her head, when she fell into the following train of reflections: "The money for which I shall sell this milk will enable me to increase my stock of eggs to three hundred. These eggs, allowing for what may prove addle and what may be destroyed by vermin, will produce at least 250 chickens. The chickens will be fit to carry to market just at the time when poultry is always dear; so that by the New Year I can not fail to have enough money to purchase a new gown. Green - let me consider - yes, green becomes my complexion best, and green it shall be. In this dress I will go to the fair, where all the young fellows will strive to have me for a partner; but no, I shall refuse every one of them, and with a disdainful toss turn from them."Transported with this idea, she could not forbear acting with her head the thought that thus passed in her mind; when, down came the can of milk! All her imaginary happiness vanished in a moment.

addle 腐坏的   vermin 害虫   disdainful 轻蔑的   forbear 忍耐

农家姑娘和她的牛奶桶 
一位农家姑娘头顶着一桶牛奶在路上走的时候，心里浮想联翩。“卖牛奶的钱将使我能把我储存的鸡蛋数量增加到三百个，这些鸡蛋，除去臭蛋和被虫子破坏的，将至少能够孵出两百五十只小鸡。小鸡长到可以拿到市场上买的时候，刚好是家禽的价格总是很贵的时候，这样在新年到来前，我就能攒够钱买一件新的长外衣。绿色的……让我再想一想……好，绿色最适合我的肤色，就要绿色的。我要穿着这件衣服到集市上去，那里所有的年轻人将争着和我跳舞。但是，不，我要一个个地拒绝他们，轻蔑地头一摇，转身而去。”想到这里，她禁不住把头脑中的这个念头付诸于行动。她头一摇，牛奶桶掉了下来。她所有幻想的幸福都在瞬间消失了。


Lesson11 English Spelling
English spelling is a "headache" for native and non-native speakers alike. As a student of mine once commented, English spelling must have been invented by one of the devil's helpers.
Do we need a spelling reform? At first, the logical answer is yes. A reform would make the language easier for everybody. It would modernize the old-fashioned spelling which was standardized before Modern English was "born".
A spelling reform is not a simple matter. First of all, it would be very expensive. Second, if spelling is supposed to reflect pronunciation, then what pronunciation should we use - R.P., American English, or some compromise? Once the decision is made, will all the speakers accept the changes? A spelling reform could start a linguistic war!
Finally there is another important consideration. Change is the natural law for all languages. It occurs more rapidly in speech than in writing. Writing slows down the speed of change, because it is more conservative than speech. Writing also acts as a unifying link among the spoken varieties.
A spelling reform would weaken the stability of the written language and thus undermine its unity. If this happened, English would no longer be a language for international communication.

conservative 保守的, 守旧的

英语拼写
英语拼写对以英语为母语的人和不以英语为母语的人来说一样令人头痛。我的一位学生曾经说，英语的拼写肯定是魔鬼的帮手发明的。
我们是不是需要一次拼写改革？乍一看，肯定的回答才合乎情理。改革将使每个人学英语更容易，使在现代英语诞生之前就已经标准化的、早已过时的英语拼写更适应现代需要。
拼写的改革并非易事。首先，花费会很高。其次，如果单词的拼写要反映其发音，那么我们应该采用何种发音呢，英国标准发音、美国发音还是两者的折中？一旦做出了决定，是否所有说英语的人都能接受这些改变呢？拼写改革可能会引发一场有关语言的大争论。
最后还有很重要的一点要考虑。语言的演变是适用所有语言的自然法则，口头语比书面语的演变发生的更快。书面语比口头语趋于保守，能减慢演变的速度，书面语在不同的口头语之间起着连接统一的作用。
拼写改革将削弱书面语的稳定性，从而破坏其统一性。如果这样的话，英语将不再是国际间交流的语言了。


Lesson12 Short-term and Long-term Memory
A well-established distinction in memory theory is that between short-term and long-term memory. The former refers to our ability to do such things as remember telephone numbers long enough to dial them; the latter concerns the wide range of ways in which experiences can affect behavior many years later. Given the two different kinds of ability, it is reasonable to hypothesize that each is represented differently in the brain. An experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that long-term memory implies a chemical change in the brain cells while short-term memory involves patterns of impulses in circuits of nerve cells.
One group of rats was taught to run through a maze. Five minutes after learning the task, they were cooled to 50C., the temperature at which all electrical activity in the brain ceases. They were then kept at this temperature for 15 minutes before being allowed to return to their normal temperature. 
They were then run through the maze again.A second group of rats were taught to run the same maze, and then immediately cooled to 50℃. for 15 minutes. After being allowed to return to their normal temperature, an attempt was made to run the second group through the maze again. It was found that rats in the first group had no difficulty with the maze the second time, suggesting that they did not have to relearn the task. Rats in the group which was cooled immediately after learning the maze, on the other hand, could not negotiate the maze successfully, i.e., they apparently could not remember what they had learned.
It was concluded from this experiment that short-term memory is unlike long-term memory. Short-term memory involves electrical impulses since at a temperature where electrical activity ceases, there is no memory. Long-term memory, in contrast, is unaffected by the disruption of electrical activity and may involve structural changes in brain cells.

短时和长时记忆 
记忆理论中一个得到公认的区别是短时记忆和长时记忆之间的区别。短时记忆指的是我们能记住电话号以便拨打所需的能力，长时记忆涉及到曾经拥有的经历在几年后仍能影响行为的诸多方式。既然存在着这两种不同的能力，假定它们在大脑里有着不同的表现方式就是理所当然的了。科学家们认为长时记忆牵涉到脑细胞的化学变化，而短时记忆涉及到神经细胞里线路的脉冲方式，他们设计了一个试验来验证这个假设。 
科学家们教会了一组老鼠如何走迷宫。学会后五分钟，它们被冷却到了五摄氏度，在这一温度，大脑里所有的电活动都会停止。保持在这一温度十五分钟之后，它们恢复到正常的体温。然后，它们被再次放入到了迷宫中。 
第二组老鼠学会如何走同样的这个迷宫之后，马上就被冷却到五摄氏度并保持十五分钟。在恢复到正常体温后，科学家们试图让第二组老鼠再次走迷宫。结果发现第一组老鼠在第二次很轻松地就走出了迷宫，说明它们不必重新学习这项任务。然而，学会走迷宫之后马上就被冷却的第二组老鼠却不能成功地走出迷宫，也就是说，它们明显记不起已经学会的东西了。
这个实验的结论是，短时记忆和长时记忆是有区别的。短时记忆涉及到电脉冲，因为在电活动停止的温度条件下，记忆就不存在了。相比之下，长时记忆不会受到电活动中断的影响，可能会涉及脑细胞的结构改变。


Lesson13 Changes of Life Caused by Computers and Automobiles
The computer and the automobile, the mainstays of modern life, share similar pasts. The computer, which has only recently become a common feature of most people's homes and offices, had its beginnings in the 1830's. At that time, the British mathematician, Charles Babbage, developed the mechanical computer. In the same way, the first type of automobile was a steam-powered vehicle invented in 1769. The gas-powered car was not mass-produced until Henry Ford's Model T in 1915, and did not become a common possession for Americans until several decades later.
Although both the computer and the automobile took a long time to become integral parts of most people's lives, once they did, they revolutionized the whole world. Today most people would rather drive their car to the office in the city than take public transportation, even though the latter may be cheaper, more convenient and safer. The reason for this is the sense of freedom, independence and privacy afforded by car travel.
In the same way, people will now spend a large amount of money to own a computer which allows them to communicate by e-mail instead of by post, and which allows them to obtain information from the Internet instead of the library.

mainstay 支柱, 中流砥柱

计算机和汽车带来的生活变化 
计算机和汽车，这两个现代生活的支柱，有着相似的过去。计算机，近年来才成为多数人家和办公室的普通用品，发端于1830年。当时，英国数学家查尔斯&#8226;巴布吉制造出了机械式计算机。同样地，1769年发明的蒸汽驱动的汽车是最早的汽车。以汽油驱动的汽车直到1915年亨利&#8226;福特发明了T型车才开始大量生产，直到几十年后才开始为美国人普遍拥有。 
尽管计算机和汽车都花了很长时间才成为大多数人生活中的必备品，但一旦成功，它们就彻底改变了整个世界。今天人们大多驾车到城市里上班，而不是乘坐公众交通工具，虽然后者可能更便宜、更便利、更安全。其原因是驾车出行能带来自由感、独立感和私密感。 
同样，今天的人们会花一大笔钱买一台电脑，从而可以通过电子邮件而不是传统邮件和他人联系，从互联网上而不是从图书馆里获得信息。


Lesson14 Habit of Reading
I read a lot of history, a little philosophy, and a good deal of science. My curiosity was too great to allow me to give much time to reflect on what I read; I could hardly wait to finish one book, so eager was I to begin another. This was always an adventure, and I would start upon a famous work as excitedly as a reasonable young man would go in to bat for his side or a nice girl goes to a dance. Now and then journalists in search of copy ask me what the most thrilling moment of my life is. If I were not ashamed to say, I might answer that it is the moment when I began to read Goethe's Faust.
I have never quite lost this feeling, and even now the first pages of a book sometimes send the blood racing through my veins. To me reading is a rest as to other people conversation or a game of cards. It is more than that; it is a necessity, and if I am deprived of it for a little while I find myself as irritable as the addict deprived of his drug. I would sooner read a timetable or a catalogue than nothing at all.

irritable 易怒的, 急躁的

阅读的习惯 
我读了很多历史书，一些哲学书和大量的科学书籍。我的好奇心太大了，使我根本就没有多少时间来反思我读的内容。我几乎等不及看完一本书，就急切地开始读下一本。阅读总是一个探索的过程，我总是兴高采烈地开始读一本名著，就像是一个有理智的小伙子急着要替自己的一方去击球，或者一个漂亮的女孩急着要去参加舞会。经常会有寻找新闻题材的记者问我，我一生中最激动人心的时刻是什么。我可以大言不惭地说，是我开始读歌德的《浮士德》的时候。 
我从来就没有失去过这种感觉，即使是现在，翻开一本书的前几页有时也会使我热血沸腾。对我来说，阅读就是休息，就像其他人会选择闲聊或者打牌。不只如此，阅读是我生命中的必需。一刻不能阅读，我就会烦躁不安，就像一个瘾君子没有了毒品。如果没有东西可读，我就会去读时刻表或者产品目录之类的东西。



Lesson15 Exercise for Ever!
In our pursuit of good health and shapeliness, most of us think immediately of dieting. If only we could eat less, we think, we'd soon be slim, happy and life would be problem-free.
It's true that dieting is one answer, though it can be the most agonizing and psychologically destructive, so why not think about it another way. Maybe it's not that we eat too much, but that we exercise too little. Most of us lead terribly sedentary lives; when we're not sitting at our office desks, we're sitting on a bus or a train or in a car or in front of the telly, and we very rarely go for a good brisk walk, let alone exert ourselves more vigorously.
Taking regular exercise can mean that you can eat decent, satisfying amounts, while not endangering your figure at all. Exercise, or better still sport - since sport is challenging, exciting and socially enjoyable too - can change your whole attitude to life. It can change a depressive, lethargic person into a happy, active one. It can change a flabby, clumsy person into a firm, perfectly controlled, and graceful one. 
Exercise, so the doctors tell us, is a necessary antidote to stress, and it will help to keep your heart and lungs working well too.

destructive 破坏(性)的   sedentary 久坐的   brisk 活泼的   exert oneself 努力, 出力   
vigorously 精力旺盛的, 有力的   lethargic 昏睡的, 瞌睡的  
 flabby 优柔寡断的, 软弱的   antidote [医]解毒剂, 矫正方法

锻炼身体不停息！ 
为了拥有健康身体和苗条身材，我们大多数人都会马上想到节食。我们认为，只要能吃得少一点，很快就能变得苗条、快乐，生活中的问题就会烟消云散。 
节食确实是一个方法，但是节食会非常痛苦，会给心理带来损害。那么，为什么不考虑一下另外一种方法呢？可能并不是我们吃得太多，而是我们锻炼的太少了。我们大多数人生活中惯于久坐，很少活动，没有坐在办公桌旁的时候，我们总是坐在公共汽车上、火车上、汽车里或者电视机前，我们很少出去轻快地散步，更不用说运动量再大一点的锻炼方式了。 
经常锻炼身体，你就可以吃好吃饱，还不会危及你的身材。锻炼身体，或者更好一点，参加体育运动&&因为体育运动富有挑战性、能振奋人心、能给人带来交际的快乐&&能够完全改变你的生活态度。它能使一个情绪低落、无精打采的人变得快乐并精力充沛。能使一个肌肉松垮、行动笨拙的人变得肌肉结实、生活规律、举止优雅。医生告诉我们，锻炼身体既是减轻压力的必要手段，也能帮助使我们的心肺处于良好的工作状态。



Lesson16 Learning English
We thought we knew the English language, having even translated a whole book from English into Russian, when we were in Siberia. I learnt English in prison from a self-instructor, but had never heard a single live English word spoken. Several years later when we arrived in London we found we could not understand a single word, and nobody understood us. At first this was very comical, but although my husband joked about it, he soon got down to the business of learning the language.
We started going to all kinds of meetings. We stood in the front row and carefully studied the orator's mouth. We went fairly often to Hyde Park, where speakers harangued the passing crowds on diverse themes. We were particularly keen on listening to one speaker of this kind. He spoke with an Irish accent, which was easier for us to understand. Nearby a Salvation Army officer uttered hysterical shouts in appeal to God Almighty, while a little further on a shop-assistant was holding forth on the hours of servitude of assistants in the big stores...
We learnt a great deal by listening to spoken English. Afterwards, by means of an advertisement, my husband found two Englishmen desirous of exchanging lessons, and began studying assiduously with them. He got to know the language fairly well.

Siberia 西伯利亚  orator 演讲者   harangue 对...高谈阔论
hold forth 滔滔不绝地表达，诉说   servitude 苦役, 苦役
desirous 渴望的   assiduously 勤勉地, 恳切地

学习英语 
我们原以为我们是会英语的，在西伯利亚的时候，我们曾经把一整本书从英语翻译成了俄语。我是在监狱的时候通过自学教程学习英语的，但是从没有听到过有人讲一个活生生的英语单词。几年之后，我们来到了伦敦，却发现自己一个单词也听不懂，也没有人能听懂我们说的英语。开始的时候这非常滑稽。虽然我丈夫拿这个开玩笑，但他也很快开始认认真真地学起了这门语言。
我们开始去参加各种各样的会议。我们站在前排，仔细地观察讲话者的口型。我们经常去海德公园，那里演讲者会对着路过的人群就不同的主题高谈阔论。我们特别喜欢听其中一位演讲者。他说话带有爱尔兰口音，对我们来讲更容易听懂。离他不远，一位救世军军官在歇斯底里地呼唤着万能的主。再远一点，一位店员在滔滔不绝地讲着在大商店里做店员的奴役般的工作……。 
通过听这些活生生的英语，我们学到了很多。后来，我丈夫通过做广告找到了两位希望交换学习的英国人，并开始勤奋地和他们一块儿学习。他把英语这门语言学得非常好。


Lesson17 Speaking Two, But Thinking in One
My own experience makes me think it only self-deception if any believes that he has two mother-tongues. He may think that he is equally master of each, yet it is invariable the case that he actually thinks in only one and is only in that one really free and creative.
If anyone assures me that he has two languages, each as thoroughly familiar to him as the other, I immediately ask him in which of them he counts and reckons, in which he can best give me the names of kitchen utensils and tools used by carpenter or smith, and in which of them he dreams. I have not yet come across anyone who, when thus tested, had not to admit that one of the languages occupied only a second place.
I can best describe it by saying that in French I seem to be strolling down the well-kept paths in a fine park, but in German to be wandering at will in a magnificent forest.
Always accustomed in French to be careful about the rhythmic arrangement of the sentence, and to strive for simplicity of expression, these things have become equally a necessity to me in German. And now through my work on the French Bach it became clear to me what literary style corresponded to my nature.

reckon 计算   stroll 散步rhythmic 有节奏的，有韵律的

说两门语言，但用一门语言来思考 
据我自己的经验，一个人如果认为自己有两种母语，那他只是自欺欺人。他可以认为自己两门语言掌握的都很好，但一成不变的事实是他只会用一门语言来思考，只有在使用这门语言时他才会轻松自如、富有创造力。 
如果有人很肯定地告诉我他会说两门语言并且同样精通，我会马上问他用哪门语言来数数和运算，他用哪门语言能准确地给出厨房用具和木工或者铁匠的工具的名称，他做梦时说哪种语言。在我所遇见的人当中，在被问及这些问题时，都会承认其中一门语言是占次要地位的。 
我可以很好地来描述这种情形，说法语时，我好像是走在美丽花园内一条被人精心照料的小路上，但在说德语时，我好像是在宏伟壮丽的森林里自由自在地漫步。 
说法语时，我总是习惯于非常仔细地安排句子的节奏，总是追求表达的简洁，而在说德语时，这些也成为了我必须要做的事情。现在，我通过研究法国巴赫的作品，清楚地知道了什么样的文学风格适合我的本性。


Lesson18 Humorous Stories
Story 1
Everyone jumped to pick the phone up when it rang. My brother was calling to announce the birth of his first child. My parents and I rushed to the hospital and met Nathan outside the maternity ward. "You've got to see the new baby!" "He's gorgeous!" At the entrance to the nursery, Nathan stopped to read the notice on the door. His face fell. "Only you can go in, Mom and Dad," he said, crestfallen. "I have to stay out here. The sign says PARENTS ONLY ADMITTED."
My father roared with laughter. "You are the parent!" he told the new father.
Story 2
Just after she received her driver's license, my daughter borrowed the family car. An hour later the phone rang.
She had locked the car doors and the key to unlock them didn't work. "It must be the wrong key," she claimed.
"If it's on the same key ring, then it's the right one," I assured her. 
"Mom," she said emphatically, "it doesn't work. The store owner tried, and so did another pedestrian. It's the wrong key!"
"Try once more," I sighed. "Then walk home if it still doesn't work."
A few minutes later the phone rang again. "The key works and I'm coming home now."
"What happened?" I asked.
"I was trying to unlock the wrong red car," she replied sheepishly.

maternity 妇产科的   gorgeous 好的, 漂亮的   crestfallen 垂头丧气的

幽默故事
故事1
电话响起时，大家都争着去拿听筒。我哥哥打电话来告诉我们他的第一个孩子出生了。我和父母亲急匆匆赶到医院，在产科病房外面见到了我的哥哥内森。“你们一定要去看看我刚出生的儿子！”“他太漂亮了！”内森在婴儿室门口停下来看门上的通告。他的脸变得阴沉起来。“爸爸，妈妈，只有你们才能进去，”他垂头丧气地说。“我不得不呆在外面。牌子上说#只允许父母进入#。”
父亲大声地笑了。“你才是父亲呀！”他对这位新爸爸说。
故事2
女儿刚拿到驾照不久，就借了家里的车出去。一个小时后，电话铃响了。
她锁了车门，现在用钥匙打不开车门了。“肯定是钥匙拿错了，”她说。
“如果钥匙圈还是同一个，钥匙就没错，”我肯定地对她说。
“妈妈，”她斩钉截铁地说，“就是打不开。商店的店主试过了，另外一位行人也试过了。钥匙就是不对。”
“再试一次吧，”我叹了口气，“还不行的话就走回家。”
几分钟后，电话铃又响了。“车门打开了，我现在就回家。”
“怎么回事？”我问道。
“我一直在试图打开别人的一辆红色轿车，”她不好意思地回答道。



Lesson19 The Dead Sea
Throughout history people all over the world have gone to special places where mineral-rich hot springs flow from beneath the earth@s surface. Countries with much volcanic activity such as Japan have many such hot springs and have established over time many customs related to taking baths in these special waters. But many other countries especially in Europe also have centuries-old traditions associated with visiting springs to cure certain types of illnesses.
One of such oldest places in the world is located in present-day Jordan and Israel. Actually, it is not a spring, but rather a sea, the Dead Sea. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle wrote about the wonders of the Dead Sea 2500 years ago. It is also said that the Egyptian Queen Cleopatra used water from the Dead Sea to keep her skin beautiful.
The Dead Sea, which has a 33 percent concentration of salts and minerals, is located at the lowest point on Earth, 390 meters below sea level. Because of this unique location, certain atmospheric, thermal, chemical and optical characteristics are found which occur nowhere else in the world. Of course, no fish can live in the Dead Sea, but no one can drown there either. The high concentration of salt allows a person to float on the surface of the water and read a newspaper without getting it wet.

concentration 浓度
optical 光学的

死海 
从古至今，世界各地的人们都去那些能从地下流出一些富含矿物质的温泉的特别的地方。火山活动频繁的国家如日本，有许多这样的温泉，并且长期以来形成了许多与在这些特殊水中沐浴有关的习俗。但很多其他国家，尤其是在欧洲，人们也到泉水中治疗某些疾病，这是有了上百年历史的古老传统。 
世界上这种最古老的地方之一就位于今天的约旦和以色列。实际上，它不是温泉，更应说是个海：死海。两千五百年前，古希腊哲学家亚里士多德就写下了有关死海奇迹的记述。据说埃及女王克利奥帕特拉用死海的水保持皮肤的美丽。 
死海中盐和矿物质的浓度是百分之三十三，它位于世界上的最低点：低于海平面三百九十米。由于这种独特的地理位置，这里有世界上其他地方找不到的某些大气、热、化学和光学的特征。当然，死海里没有鱼，但人在那里不会溺水。高浓度的盐能让人能浮在海面阅读报纸而不会把报纸打湿。


Lesson20 Sleep
Scientists suggest that today, most adults get up to two hours' less sleep than they need. As a result those lacking in sleep are forgetful, tired, less productive and grumpy.
Sleep is the time when our bodies and minds are rested and restored. There are two types of sleep: Rapid Eye Movement and Non-REM. We need both types to be healthy. Rapid Eye Movement sleep is when we dream. Our brains are active, and our eyes have fast short movements, as if watching something. This type of sleep helps restore our mind. Non-REM sleep is when our brain and body slow down. Our heart rate slows and our breathing is regular. This type of sleep helps restore our body. We have twice as much Non-REM sleep as Rapid Eye Movement sleep each night.
To get better sleep, have a regular time for sleeping and a routine before you go to bed. This will give your body the signal that it is time to sleep. Make sure the bed and bedroom are quiet and comfortable. If your bed is too hard or too soft, if you are too cold or too hot, you will not sleep well. 
For two hours before going to bed do not drink coffee or alcohol, or do not smoke or exercise. All these activities stimulate your body and make sleep difficult.

grumpy 脾气坏的, 脾气暴躁的

睡眠 
科学家指出当今大多数成年人的睡眠时间要比正常需要的时间少两个小时。结果是，睡眠不足的这些人健忘、疲惫、工作效率低下、性情乖戾。 
睡眠是我们身体和心智休息和恢复的时间。睡眠有两种形式：快速眼动睡眠和非快速眼动睡眠。这两种睡眠我们都需要，以维护我们的健康。快速眼动睡眠时，我们在做梦。我们的大脑很活跃，眼睛在快速运动好像在看什么东西。这种形式的睡眠帮助我们恢复心智。非快速眼动睡眠时，我们的大脑和身体活动减少，心跳变慢，呼吸均匀。这种形式的睡眠帮助我们恢复体力。每天晚上，我们的非快速眼动睡眠时间是快速眼动睡眠时间的两倍。 
要想睡得更好，睡觉的时间要有规律，睡觉前要有特定的程序。这样会给身体一个要睡觉了的信号。要确保床和卧室安静舒适。如果床太硬了或者太软了，身体太热了或者太冷了，都睡不好。睡觉前两个小时内不要喝咖啡或酒精饮料，不要抽烟或者锻炼身体。这些活动会使你的身体兴奋起来，使入睡变得困难。



Lesson21 Blues and Jazz
People from Europe and America brought Africans to America as slaves before and during the nineteenth century. These Africans brought their music with them. After the American Civil War (1861&1865), the African-American people in the United States were not slaves. Their African-American music became famous. It started in the South, in Louisiana and Mississippi. Then it travelled to the north. This music became blues and then jazz.
Blues and jazz became very popular in the twentieth century. A person who "sings the blues" feels sad. Usually, he or she lost something - a person or maybe money or a job. Blues express sad feelings sometimes in a funny way. People played blues first with only one or two instruments, for example, a guitar, a harmonica, or sometimes a piano. Sometimes they sang without any instruments. Some famous blues musicians are Bessie Smith, John Lee Hooker, and B.B. King.
Jazz came soon after blues. Composers added more musical instruments. Jazz can be happier and is often faster. Some famous jazz musicians are Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, and Wynton Marsalis.
Musicians who play blues and jazz change the music to show their emotions. They play the music differently each time. 
Today people all over the world still like to listen to blues and jazz because all people have strong emotional feelings sometimes.

blues 蓝调音乐, 布鲁斯   harmonica 口琴

布鲁斯和爵士乐
十九世纪前以及在十九世纪，欧洲人和美国人把非洲人作为奴隶带到了美洲。这些非洲人带来了他们的音乐。美国内战 
（1861@@1865）后，美国黑人成了自由人。他们的美国黑人音乐也声名远扬。它开始于南方的路易斯安那和密西西比，后来传到了北方。这种音乐后来演变成布鲁斯，再后来成了爵士乐。 
布鲁斯和爵士乐在二十世纪变得非常流行。吟唱布鲁斯乐曲的人通常很悲伤，他通常失去了什么，可能是亲人、金钱或者工作。布鲁斯有时候以一种有趣的方式表达悲伤的情感。最早人们只用一两种乐器演奏布鲁斯，例如，吉它、口琴或者有时候是钢琴。有时吟唱时没有任何乐器伴奏。贝西&#8226;史密斯、约翰&#8226;李&#8226;胡克和B&#8226;B&#8226;金是著名的布鲁斯音乐家。 
爵士乐紧随着布鲁斯而出现。作曲家们使用了更多的乐器。爵士乐表现很欢乐的情感，节奏也更快些。杜克&#8226;艾林顿、路易斯&#8226;阿姆斯特朗、迈尔斯&#8226;戴维斯和温顿&#8226;马萨里斯是著名的爵士音乐家。 
演奏布鲁斯和爵士乐的乐手为表达自己的情感会改变曲调。他们每次演奏的方式都不一样。当今世上还有很多人喜欢听布鲁斯和爵士乐，因为每个人都不时会有强烈的情感要表达。



Lesson22 Bounty of Love
My mother had a habit of keeping my letters, binding them carefully in neat bundles with green tape, but this was her own secret. She never told me she was doing it. In 1957, when she knew she was dying, I was in hospital in Oxford having a serious operation on my spine and I was unable to write to her. So she had a telephone specially installed beside her bed in order that she might have one last conversation with me. 
She didn't tell me she was dying, nor did anyone else for that matter, because I was in a fairly serious condition myself at the time. She simply asked me how I was and hoped I would get better soon and sent me her love. I had no idea that she would die the next day. She knew perfectly that her life was numbered in hours, but she still wanted to reach out and speak to me for the last time.
When I recovered and went home, I was given this vast collection of my letters, all neatly bound with a green tape, more than six hundred of them altogether, dating from 1925 to 1945, each one in its original envelope with the old stamps still on them. I am very lucky to have something like this to 
refer to in my old age.

bounty 慷慨    spine 脊柱

慷慨母爱 
母亲习惯保存我写给她的信件，她把这些信小心翼翼地用绿丝带捆得整整齐齐。但这是她自己的秘密，她从来没有告诉过我她在这么做。1957年，她知道自己将不久于人世了，那时我正在牛津住院，做一个重大的脊椎手术，所以无法给她写信。于是，她让人专门给她的床边安装了一部电话，这样她就能够和我最后说上几句话。她没有告诉我她即将要不久人世了，别的人也没有告诉我，因为我当时自己的身体状况也很不乐观。她只是问我怎么样了，希望我早日康复，并且说她爱我。我丝毫不知她第二天就要去世了。她很清楚地知道自己在这世上也就几个小时的光景了，但仍然想要最后一次和我通话。 
我康复后回到家，拿到了那一大捆我的信件，整整齐齐地用绿丝带捆着，总共有六百多封，写信的时间是在1925到1945年间，每一封都装在原来的信封里，贴着原来的旧邮票。在年老时能拥有像这样的东西时常翻看我真是幸运。



Lesson23 Night School
Each weekday evening, a reverse rush hour takes place in Manhattan's Greenwich Village. While the average New Yorker is trudging home from their job, a few thousand others are piling into the three modern buildings that house the New School for Social Research. The 54-year-old institution is a full-fledged university, but most of its students are not concerned with accumulation credits or earning degrees. Nor are they apple-cheeked youngsters: a typical New School student is the wage-earning adult who has signed up for a course in anything from sociology to computer programming to creative knitting in an effort to broaden his intellectual or occupational horizons. "I don't want my mind to fall asleep while I have to work," says a young banker who has signed up for a course in psychology.
The New School today remains the only degree-granting university in the nation devoted primarily to the education of adults. As such, it may well be riding the pedagogical wave of the future. Recently, the Educational Testing Service reported that nearly 80 million adult Americans want or need continuing education, but that less than half of them are getting it. 
Reflecting this thirst for learning, enrolment at the New School has doubled in the past decade, and of the 13,000 students taking one or more of its 8,875 courses this semester, more than 80 per cent attend evening classes.

trudge 跋涉   pedagogical 教育学的, 教学法的

夜校 
周一到周五的每天晚上，在曼哈顿的格林威治村都会出现一股反常的交通高峰。当普通的纽约人都在下班往家里赶的时候，几千人却涌入了“社会研究新学校”所在的三座现代化的大厦里。这所学校已经有54年的历史了，是一所颇有名声的大学，但是这所学校的学生并不关心积累学分或者拿到学位，他们也不是有着红扑扑脸蛋的年轻人。一名典型的“新学校”学生是有工作的成人，为了拓宽自己的智力或职业视野，他们报名参加了社会学、计算机编程、创造性编织等各种课程。“我可不想让我的大脑在我工作的时候睡着了”，一位报名参加了心理学课程的年轻的银行职员说。 
“新学校”当今仍然是全美国唯一一所主要从事成人教育的、有资格授予学位的大学。因此，它可以说是引领着未来的教学潮流。美国教育考试服务中心最近的报告显示，有将近八千万的成年美国人希望或者需要参加继续教育，但是他们中只有不到一半的人做得到。过去十年间，“新学校”的入学人数翻了一番，这也反映了人们对学习的渴望。学校这学期开设了8785门课程，13000名学生每人参加一门或多门课程，有80%的学生上的是夜校课程。


Lesson24 On Employment for the Younger and the Older
A study of the results of this survey suggests that older workers are likely to make better employees than younger ones. 
This conclusion is based partly on a comparison of the views of these two groups of workers on factors contributing to career success. Honesty is more highly rated by older workers than by their younger counterparts, suggesting that older workers are likely to be more trustworthy. They are also more cautious in their approach to work, unlike younger workers, who are prone to take risks which can have disastrous consequences. In addition, the high value older workers place on being sociable points to their greater readiness to work for good relationships with other members of the workforce. 
There is no denying that a good working atmosphere is vital for the smooth operation of an organization. This emphasis on sociability is also reflected in the importance older workers attach to having contacts. Both establishing and maintaining useful contacts are necessary in the modern business world.
Secondly, in terms of priorities in choosing a job, older workers show themselves to be more stable and committed than their younger counterparts. Not only are they less concerned about money, they are also much more realistic in their job expectations and consequently less likely to be frustrated on account of lack of excitement or challenge in their everyday work. All this, together with their interest in long-term security, means that older workers are more committed to the job they hold and less likely to move from one job to another in search of new stimulation. It is this commitment that older workers have to their job that perhaps argues most strongly in their favor as being better employees.

counterpart 相对物；对方

论年龄与就业之关系 
对此项调查结论的研究表明，年龄大的雇员相比年轻的，更可能成为优秀的员工。此结论部分来自于对年老和年轻这两组员工在促成事业成功的因素上的观点的比较。诚实在年老员工那里得到的评价高于年轻者，这表明年老的员工可能更值得信任。他们对待工作的方法更谨慎，而不像年轻的员工倾向冒险，而可能会带来灾难性的后果。此外，年老员工给予合群很高评价，表明他们更乐意和其他员工发展良好关系。不可否认，好的工作氛围对一个组织的和谐运转至关重要。这种对社交的强调同样反映在年老员工认为保持互相联系很重要上。在当今商界，建立和保持有益的联系是很有必要的。
其次，在选择工作时优先考虑的事项方面，年龄大的员工比年轻员工显示出了更强的稳定性和忠诚度。他们不仅对钱关注较少，而且对工作的期待要现实得多，因此不容易因日常工作缺乏活力和挑战而灰心丧气。所有这些，加上他们对长期稳定的工作感兴趣，意味着年龄大的员工更效忠于自己已有的工作，而不大可能为了追求新的刺激而跳槽。或许正是年龄大的员工对自己工作的这种忠诚，在证明他们是更好的雇员方面最有说服力。


Lesson25 Globalization of Food Diversity 
In the 1990s, when use of the term "globalization" had become commonplace, it appeared that the long record of interconnections between peoples and places had greatly intensified over the previous 30 years, producing an increasingly compressed economic, political and cultural world. Greater awareness of these compressions had given rise to the concept of the globalization of the food system. Time out had stated that one could find "The world on a plate," and it had urged its readers to "Give your tongue a holiday and treat yourself to the best meals in the world - all without setting foot outside our fair capital." The implication of this claim was that the culinary culture to be found in London had not submitted to the homogenization promoted by a monolithic transnational capitalism (in other words "McDonaldization") , but had staged, and perhaps reconstructed, cultural differences to create a "globalization of diversity".
Scholars pointed out that cultural diversity sells and that the touristic quality of food was now being exploited. What was being sold purported to be an authentic example of an exotic dish, and this was being reinforced by messages imparted by the décor and other features of the location in which the food was served.

compressed 压缩的，缩小的   give rise to 引起、导致   culinary 饮食的、烹饪的
submit 臣服于…, 屈服于…   homogenisation 一体化（消灭差异性）
monolithic 单一的   McDonaldization 麦当劳化（指麦当劳快餐文化）
purport 达到…的目的   impart 给予

食物的全球化 
二十世纪九十年代，“全球化”成为了一个家喻户晓的词语，世界各民族和各地区之间的联系在过去的三十年里达到了空前的程度，使得地球从经济、政治和文化角度上看变得越来越小。日益缩小的地球也引起了人们对饮食文化全球化的关注。《旅游报》曾声称人们可以找到“餐盘中的世界”，并鼓励其读者“奖励你的舌头一天假期，款待一下自己，去品尝全世界的美味佳肴&&就在我们美丽的首都！”这一宣传背后所蕴藏的理念是伦敦的饮食文化成功地抵抗住了横扫一切他人文化的跨国资本主义（就是说“麦当劳文化”）的冲击，展现了，也许该说是重新构建了文化的差异性，创造出了“多元文化全球化”的例子。 
学者们指出，文化多元化就是卖点，饮食旅游化正在兴起。出售外国饮食就是展示异国的饮食文化，如果加上饮食地点的装饰和其他地区特色，这种文化的展示还将得到强化。


Lesson26 Human Brain
The human brain is divided into two sides called the right brain and the left brain. The two sides work together, but each one specializes in certain ways of thinking. Each side has its own way of using information to help us think, understand, and process information.
The left side of the brain controls language. It is more verbal and logical. It names things and puts them into groups. 
It uses rules and likes ideas to be clear, logical, and orderly. It is best at speech, reading, writing and math. You use this side of the brain when you memorize spelling and grammar rules or when you do a math problem.
The right side of the brain is more visual and creative. It specializes in using information it receives from the senses of sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste. This side of the brain likes to dream and experiment. It controls your appreciation of music, colour, and art. You use this side when you draw a picture or listen to music.
Although we all use both sides of our brains, one side is usually stronger or dominant. Some people are more "left-brained," and others are more "right-brained." Our dominant side influences the kinds of jobs and hobbies we have. Politicians, artists, architects, and musicians depend on their right brains. Accountants, engineers, doctors, and lawyers usually rely on their left brains.

orderly 有条理的

人类的大脑 
人类的大脑由左脑和右脑两部分组成。这两部分分工协作，分别负责人类的某些思维方式。每一部分都有自己利用信息的方式，帮助我们思考、理解和处理信息。 
左脑控制语言能力，偏重于文字及逻辑性。它给事物命名并分类。它使用规则，偏爱清晰、有逻辑性和有条理的概念。它擅长语言、阅读、写作和数学。当你记单词拼写或解数学题的时候，你用的是这半边的大脑。 
右脑偏向于形象化，有创造力。它专门用于处理视觉、听觉、嗅觉、触觉和味觉五大感觉器官传送来的信息。这半边大脑喜欢做梦和尝试。它控制着我们欣赏音乐、颜色和艺术的能力。你在画画或者听音乐时用的是右脑。 
虽然我们每个人都要使用左脑和右脑，但其中有一边总是更发达一些，占主要地位。有些人的左脑更发达，而有些人的右脑更发达。哪边大脑更发达会影响到我们的工作和业余爱好。政治家、艺术家、建筑师和音乐家依赖于他们的右脑，而会计、工程师、医生和律师通常依赖于他们的左脑。


Lesson27 Learning
The attitude toward writing that these students have developed is well illustrated by a story told by the Russian writer Chekhov about a kitten that was given to his uncle. The uncle wanted to make the kitten a champion killer of mice, so while it was still very young, he showed it a live mouse in a cage. 
Since the kitten's hunting instinct had not yet developed, it examined the mouse curiously but without any hostility. The uncle wanted to teach it that such fraternizing with the enemy was wrong, so he slapped the kitten, scolded it and sent it away in disgrace.
The next day the same mouse was shown to the kitten again. 
This time the kitten regarded it rather fearfully but without any aggressive intent. Again the uncle slapped it, scolded it and sent it away. This treatment went on day after day. After sometimes, as soon as the kitten saw or smelled that mouse, it screamed and tried to climb up the walls. At that point the uncle lost patience and gave the kitten away, saying that it was stupid and would never learn. Of course the kitten had learned perfectly, and had learned exactly what it had been taught, but unfortunately not what the uncle intended to teach. "I can sympathize with that kitten," says Chekhov, "because that same uncle tried to teach me Latin."

学习 
俄罗斯作家契诃夫所讲述的关于一只送给他叔叔的小猫的故事很好地阐明了这些学生对写作的态度。叔叔想要把这只小猫训练成一只超级老鼠杀手。所以在猫还很小的时候，叔叔就向它展示一只关在笼子里的活老鼠。小猫的捕杀本能还没有发展起来，它只是好奇地打量着这只老鼠，没有一丝敌意。叔叔想要让它知道，对敌人这么友好是错的，于是就打了小猫一巴掌，训了它一顿，打发它灰溜溜地走了。 
第二天，叔叔又把这只老鼠拿来展示给小猫。这一次，小猫有点胆怯地注视着老鼠，但是还是没有任何攻击的企图。于是叔叔又打了它一巴掌，骂了它几句，让它到一边去了。这样的情形天天如此，持续了好些天。过了一段时间，小猫一看到这只老鼠或者闻到它的味道，就会尖叫一声，想要朝墙上爬。到这时，叔叔再也忍受不下去了，就把小猫送人了，还说这只猫太笨了，不知道学习。当然，这只猫学得非常好，它学到了叔叔教给它的东西，然而遗憾的是，这不是叔叔想要教的。“我很同情这只猫，”契诃夫说，“因为正是这位叔叔试图要教我学拉丁语。”



Lesson28 You Can Be a Super-Achiever
Everyone knows about straight-A students. We see them frequently in TV sitcoms and in movies like Revenge of the Nerds. They get high grades, all right, but only by becoming dull grinds, their noses always stuck in a book. They're klutzes at sports and dweebs when it comes to the opposite 
sex.
How, then, do we account for Domenica Roman or Paul Melendres?
Roman is on the tennis team at senior high school. She also sings in the choral ensemble, serves on the student council and is a member of the mathematics society. For two years she has maintained a 4.0 grade-point average, meaning A's in every subject.
Melendres, now a freshman at university, was student - body president when he was at high school. He played varsity soccer and junior-varsity basketball, exhibited at the science fair, was chosen for the national association of student councils and did student commentaries on a local television station. 
Valedictorian of his class, he achieved a GPA of 4.4 - straight A's in his regular classes, plus bonus points for A's in two college-level honours courses.
How do super-achievers like Roman and Melendres do it? Brains aren't the only answer. "Top grades don't always go to the brightest students," declares the experts of education who have conducted major studies of super-achieving students. 
"Knowing how to make the most of your innate abilities counts for more. Infinitely more."

你也能成为顶级的学生
每个人都知道学习成绩全优的学生，他们经常出现在电视情景喜剧和如《鬼马校园》这样的电影里。是的，他们成绩很优秀，但同时也成了书呆子，整天脑袋都钻在书本里。他们不擅长体育运动，在与异性交往方面也是呆头呆脑的。
那么，如何解释多米尼加&#8226;洛曼和保罗&#8226;米伦德里斯呢？
洛曼是所在高中的校网球队队员，她还是合唱团的成员，在学生会任职，还是数学协会的会员。两年来，她每门课的平均成绩保持在四分，也就是每门课得到的都是A。
米伦德里斯现在是大学一年级的学生，在中学时是学生会主席。他是大学足球队和大学篮球二队的队员，参加过科学展览会，被选为全国学生联合会会员，在地方电视台做过学生评论员。他是他们班致告别词的学生代表，每门课的平均成绩为四点四分&&主课都是A，还有两门大学预修课程得A后的加分。
像洛曼和米伦德里斯这样的顶级学生是如何成功的呢？智力不是唯一的答案。“高分的学生并不都是最聪明的学生，”对顶级学生做过重要研究的教育专家这样说，“知道如何充分利用你的内在能力更为重要，并且这一点要重要的多。"



Lesson29 Alcohol Damage to the Young Brain
Few teens seem to worry about what alcohol does to their bodies. Cirrhosis of the liver is unlikely to catch up with them for decades, and heart disease must seem as remote as retirement, but recent research indicates that the younger the brain, the more it may be at risk. Because their brains are still developing, teens who drink excessively may be destroying some of their mental capacity - affecting their ability to learn.
Nearly 7 million youths between the ages of 12 and 20 binge drink at least once a month, according to the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. That means downing five or more drinks in a row.
Teen drinkers appear to be most susceptible to damage in two developing parts of the brain, the hippocampus, a structure responsible for learning and memory, and the prefrontal cortex, the chief decision-maker and voice of reason.
In a study of how alcohol affects the hippocampus, scholars dosed adolescent and adult rats with alcohol and ran them through mazes. Compared with the adults, the adolescents failed miserably. To see whether similar results held true for humans, some scholars split a small group of volunteers into two groups: ages 21 to 24, and 25 to 29.
After drinking enough to achieve a blood-alcohol level slightly below 0.08 percent, the younger group's learning was significantly more impaired than the older group's.

酒精对青少年大脑的伤害 
青少年似乎并不担心酒精对他们身体的伤害。几十年内他们不大可能会得肝硬化，心脏病对他们来讲如同退休一样遥远。但是最近的研究表明大脑越年轻，越容易受到伤害。因为青少年的大脑还在发育，过度饮酒可能会损害他们的智力&&影响他们的学习能力。 
美国管制药品滥用及精神卫生管理局的数据表明，将近700万12到20岁之间的青少年每个月至少有一次过量饮酒，也就是连续喝酒五杯或五杯以上。 
青少年饮酒者的大脑的两个正在发育的部分最容易受到伤害，它们是负责学习和记忆的海马状突起和主要的决策和理性中心&&前额皮质。 
在一个研究酒精对海马状突起的影响的实验中，研究者给幼年的和成年的老鼠服用了酒精后把它们放到了迷宫里。与成年老鼠相比，幼年的老鼠惨败。为了验证在人类身上是否也会有相似的结果，一些研究者把一小群志愿者分成了两组，21至24年龄组和25至29年龄组。 
给他们饮酒使他们血液内的酒精含量达到略低于0.08%的水平后，年龄稍小的那一组的学习能力受到的损害明显大于年龄大的那一组。



Lesson30 Spin-off Technology
Some people wonder why countries spend millions of dollars on space projects. They want to know how space research helps people on Earth. Actually space technology helps people on Earth every day. This is called "spin-off technology." 
Spin-off technology is space technology that is now used on Earth.
In early space programs, such as the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s, and in the Space Shuttle missions today, scientists developed objects for the astronauts to use on the moon and in space. We now use some of these objects every day. 
For example, we have Quartz crystal clocks and watches with accuracy of one minute a year. We purify the water we drink with a water filter designed for the astronauts' use in space. 
The cordless, hand-held tools we use in our homes, such as vacuum cleaners, flashlights, drills and saws came from the technology of these early space programs.
On cold winter days we can stay warm with battery-operated gloves and socks, and insulated coats and jackets. All of these clothes are similar to the spacesuit designs that kept astronauts comfortable in the temperatures of the moon, and are spin-offs from space technology.
These products are only a few examples of the many ways space technology helps us in our everyday lives. No one knows how new spin-off technology from the International Space Station will help us in the future.

spin-off 副产品

副产品技术 
一些人会怀疑有些国家在太空项目上花费数百万美元是为什么。他们想知道太空研究如何能使地球上的人们受益。实际上，太空技术给地球上人们的日常生活带来了便利。我们称之为“副产品技术”，即现在地球上使用的太空技术。 
在早期的太空计划中，如20世纪60年代和70年代的阿波罗计划，和今天的航天飞机计划中，科学家们开发了供宇航员们在月球上和太空中使用的物品，其中有一些成了我们今天日常生活中使用的物品。例如，我们现在使用的石英钟和石英表的精确度达到了一年误差不超过一分钟。我们使用原本为宇航员设计在太空中使用的滤水器来净化我们的饮用水。我们家里使用的电池式手提工具，如真空吸尘器、手电筒、钻子和锯子，都来自这些早期太空计划中的技术。
在寒冷的冬日里，我们可以戴上由干电池提供热能的手套和袜子、穿上隔热材料做的外套和夹克来保暖。所有这些衣服都类似于为了使宇航员在月球上的温度条件下保持身体舒适的太空服，都是太空技术的副产品。 
这些产品只是我们的日常生活如何从太空技术中受益的几个例子。没有人知道源自于国际空间站的副产品技术会在未来给我们的生活带来什么样的好处。


Lesson31 Workmen in Books and Real Life
These songs filled me with a deep feeling of envy towards the singer and his wonderful power over people. Something painfully disturbing flowed into my heart, making it swell until it began to hurt. I felt like crying and wanted to shout out to all those singing people: I love you all!
I have read many stories about working men and I could already see the vast difference between men in books and those in real life. In books all workmen seemed to be unhappy. Whether they were good or evil they were inferior to real workmen in thought and expression. Workmen in books spoke less about God, religious sects and the church and more about the "authorities, the land, truth and the burdens of life. They even spoke friendly.
For the real-life working man, women were only a source of amusement - but a dangerous one: with women one always had to be cunning or else they would get the upper hand and ruin one's life.
Working men in books seemed to be either good or bad and that was the end of it. Real ones, however, were neither good nor bad and as a result they were terribly interesting. However much a real workman poured his heart out one always felt that he was holding something back, something he did not wish others to know - and it was perhaps this that was most important.

sect 宗派, 教派   cunning 狡猾的

书中描述的工人和现实中的工人 
这些歌曲使我的内心充满了对歌手和他拥有的控制他人的力量的嫉妒。我心中有一种令我不安又痛苦的情绪，它不断膨胀，使我痛苦不已。我想哭，想对所有歌唱的人大喊：我爱你们！ 
我读过许多有关工人的故事，已经看到了书中描述的人们和现实中的他们的巨大差异。书中的工人们似乎都不幸福。不管他们是善还是恶，都比现实中的工人在思想上和表达方式上低一等。 
书中的工人较少地谈到上帝、宗教派别和教堂，他们更多地谈论权威、土地、真相和生活的重担。他们说话的方式也很友好。对现实生活中的工人来说，女人是一种消遣方式，而且是很危险的一种：在女人方面，男人总是要很有心计，否则女人就会占上风而毁掉男人的生活。
书中的工人似乎不是好人就是坏人，说穿了似乎就是这么回事。在现实生活中，他们既不是好人也不是坏人， 因而特别有趣。 
但是无论一个工人如何敞开心扉，别人总会觉得他还有所保留，会有些东西他不愿意让别人知道。可能这才是最重要的一点。



Lesson32 John Henry
John Henry is one of the famous heroes of American folklore. He worked on the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad toward the end of the nineteenth century.
John Henry was very strong. He made his mark in history because he could work harder and faster than any other man on the railroad. Curious people came from far and wide to see him hammer steel spikes through the hard earth. When the Big Bend Tunnel was started, trouble began. The mountain seemed impossible to get through. The men who were building the railroad bought a new invention, a drilling machine, to try to speed up the tunneling. The other railroad workers welcomed the machine, but not John Henry. He stubbornly insisted he could work harder and faster than any machine. "I'll die with a hammer in my hand, before I let a machine make a fool out of me," he said.
And so a competition was planned. It would last for 45 minutes, or until one of the competitions gave up. The winner would be the man or machine who had drilled fartherest into the rock. Hundreds of people went to Big Bend to watch this great attraction.
After 30 minutes, the machine broke down, but John Henry kept right on working for 45 minutes. The machine had drilled only nine feet. John Henry, 15 feet. He had won a great victory, but the effort had been too much. As the song goes, "He died with the hammer in his hand, Lord, Lord ... died with the hammer in his hand."


约翰&#8226;亨利
约翰&#8226;亨利是美国民间传说中一位著名的英雄人物。他于19世纪末在切萨皮克和俄亥俄铁路上工作。 
约翰&#8226;亨利非常强壮。他之所以名垂史册是因为他比铁路上的任何其他人工作更努力更快。好奇的人们从四面八方赶来看他用锤子把铁钎打入坚硬的土地。
大本德隧道开始修建的时候遇到了困难。看起来没有可能打通大山了。将新发明的钻机买了回来，以加快开凿隧道的速度。其他的铁路工人都很欢迎这种机器，但是亨利不喜欢。他固执地认为自己工作起来比任何机器更努力更快。“我宁可手拿锤子死去，也不愿受机器的愚弄。”他说。 
于是，人们策划了一场比赛。比赛将持续45分钟，或者到比赛的一方放弃为止。胜者将是在岩石上开凿距离最远的机器或人。成百上千的人来到大本德观看这场引人注目的比赛。 
30分钟后，机器因故障停了下来，但约翰&#8226;亨利没有停，他一直工作了45分钟。机器仅开凿了9英尺，而约翰&#8226;亨利开凿了15英尺。他大获全胜。然而这个努力的代价太大了，正如歌中所唱，“他手拿锤子死去了，主呀，主呀，他手拿锤子死去了。”


Lesson33 On Social Equality
There have been few examples in history of a truly classless society where, to any significant degree, equality of pay and conditions prevailed. Two short-lived examples are the Paris Commune of 1871 which was ruthlessly destroyed by the forces of the French government and the anarchist regime that controlled Barcelona in the early days of the Spanish Civil War which was ironically brought to violent end.
Today in Europe there is a new class which is growing apace that has come to be known as the underclass or sub-class. This class consists of groups of individuals who do not have access to the rights enjoyed by members of other social strata. Indeed, in order to secure very basic living conditions taken for granted by others, they are often forced to suffer the indignity of a means test, be at the receiving end of charity and have to rely on run-down public services. The worlds of private transport, private health care, private education and private housing are remote and inaccessible.
The underclass consists of the poor, the homeless, many of the unemployed, the emotionally disturbed, and the disabled. A high proportion will be from ethnic minorities, many being employed illegally at low wage levels and under sweatshop conditions. Some will be employed completely illegally; their very existence unrecognized and unrecorded by the authorities. 
This class also includes drug addicts, prostitutes and alcoholics. The underclass is the unspoken but ever-present shadow of our modern lifestyle.
Whereas the poor of the last century were employed and formed the working class, the poor of today are now largely unemployed and form part of the underclass.

anarchist 无政府主义者   means 财力；收入

论社会公平 
历史上鲜有真正的无阶级差别的社会，那种在较大程度上盛行薪酬和社会地位平等的社会。有两个短暂存在的社会是其适例，一个是1871年的巴黎公社，被法国政府的军队无情摧毁，另一个是在西班牙内战早期控制巴塞罗纳的无政府主义政权，具有讽刺意义的是，它以暴力手段收场。 
如今在欧洲一个新阶级正在快速成长，它被称为下层阶级或亚阶级。该阶级由那些无法享有其他社会阶层的成员所享有的权利的群体组成。事实上，为了确保在其他人看来是理所当然拥有的最基本的生存条件，他们经常被迫遭受有辱尊严的收入调查，接受施舍，以及不得不依靠每况愈下的公共服务。拥有私人交通、私人医疗保健、私人教育和私人住宅的世界对他们来说遥不可及。 
该下层阶级包括穷人、无家可归者、众多失业者、情感受挫者和残疾人。少数民族占很大比例，很多人非法受雇，工资很低，且工作条件极差。有些人完全是非法打工，他们的存在没有得到政府当局的认可和记录。这一阶级也包括吸毒者、妓女和酗酒的人。该下层阶级是我们现代生活方式中不可言及却又永远存在的阴影。
上个世纪的穷人拥有工作并形成了工人阶级，而如今的穷人大多都是失业者并形成了下层阶级的一部分。



Lesson34 Food of the Future?
Scientists are always trying out new ways of growing food, even though they can only guess what food will be like in the future. Here are some of their imaginations.
The sea can be farmed. Only one third of the earth's area is island. The remainder is sea. The ocean contains huge amounts of tiny sea-animals called Krill. Krill are already in some fish products, such as fish sticks and canned crab. Next time you buy canned or frozen seafood look carefully at the label. 
You might see krill listed as one of the ingredients. Seaweed is another source of future food from the ocean. It is used in ice cream and some bread.
Animals can be changed. A farmer is able to "engineer" his animals by adding hormones to their feed. Hormones can make chicken meat more tender or beef less fat. For example, dairy farmers add growth hormones so that calves produce milk sooner than normal.
New crops can be planted.
Today, rice supports more than half the world's population. But it takes a lot of water to grow rice. Scientists predict the climate will get drier during the next century. Therefore, it might be impossible to grow rice in the future. Some farmers are experimenting with new crops. Farmers like to grow beans because they don't need much water, and beans also improve the quality of the soil. The soybean makes a good substitute for rice and meat.

krill [动]磷虾   fish stick 冻鱼条   hormone 荷尔蒙, 激素

未来的食物？
科学家即使只能猜测未来的食物是什么样子， 也还要经常尝试种植粮食的新方法。下面是一些他们的想象。 
我们可以从海洋中获取食物。只有三分之一的地球表面是陆地，其他部分是海洋。海洋里有大量的叫做磷虾的微小海洋动物。磷虾已经用于一些鱼制品，如冻鱼条和罐装的螃蟹之中。下次你买了罐装的或冷冻的海产食品时，仔细看看标签，或许能看到列在食物成分中的磷虾。海洋中的海藻是未来食物的另一种原料来源。它现在用于冰激凌和一些面包。

牲畜可被改变。农夫能在饲料中添加荷尔蒙来“制造”他的牲畜。荷尔蒙能使鸡肉更嫩，或使牛肉脂肪变少。比如，奶牛场主添加生长荷尔蒙，能使小牛提前产奶。
人们可种植新品种作物。现在，大米供养世界一半多的人口。但是大米生长要许多水。科学家预测下世纪气候会变得更干燥。因此，未来或许不可能种大米了。有些农民在实验新品种作物。他们喜欢种植豆子，因为豆子需水不多，而且还能改善土壤品质。大豆是大米和肉的不错的替代物。



Lesson35 Holidays and Vacations in the US
In some countries, holidays and vacations are the same thing. That is because people in those countries take their vacations only when there is a holiday. But that is not necessarily how it is done in the United States.
In America, holidays are simply days set aside for the celebration of a particular event, such as historical or religious commemorations. The word holiday originally meant "holy day," signifying an important day on the religious calendar. Today, however, the word has nothing to do with religion.
There are holidays of both religious and secular significance. The religious holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, are well known because they are shared by the many countries of the Christian world. But there are many secular holidays, too, such as Veteran's Day, Memorial Day and Labour Day. Holidays like these were established to honour persons who have served their nation or died in the service of their country and those whose labour makes the country strong.
All of these are holidays, but they aren't vacations. 
Vacations are usually longer than holidays. A person on vacation often travels out of town to see the country, or to visit relatives, and might be gone for several weeks or longer. They almost always use paid vacation time, and they must, of course, first get permission from their employer.
Sometimes vacations are taken together with holidays, especially during the "holiday season." This starts with Thanksgiving Day, the fourth Thursday in November, and ends with New Year's Day.

commemoration 纪念, 纪念会   secular 世俗的, 非宗教的

美国的节日和假日
在有些国家，节日和假日是一回事，因为在这些国家里，人们只有在节日时才会有假日。但是在美国情况却不一定是这样。 
在美国，节日是用来庆祝某一特殊事件的，例如历史或者宗教纪念活动。“节日”这个词在英语中的原义是“神圣的日子”，指的是宗教日历上的重要日子。然而，这个词现在与宗教没有任何关系。 
有些节日具有宗教意义，有些没有。宗教节日例如圣诞节和复活节是为人所熟知的，因为它们在基督教世界的许多国家都有庆祝活动。但是也有一些非宗教的节日，例如退伍军人节、阵亡将士纪念日和劳动节。设立这些节日是用来纪念那些为曾经服务祖国的人们、为国捐躯的人们和为祖国的强大而辛苦劳作的人们。 
所有这些都是节日，但不是假日。假日通常比节日持续时间要长。度假的人经常要外出旅游观光或者探亲访友，可能要离开几个星期或者更长的时间。他们几乎都是带薪度假，当然要事先征得老板的同意。 
有时候，度假的时间和节日刚好重合，特别是在圣诞节前后的“度假旺季”里，即从感恩节，十一月的第四个星期四，一直到元旦这段时间。



Lesson36 No Place to Hide
In an interview last month, Frank Church, chairman of the Senate committee that is investigating the CIA, issued an oblique but impassioned warning, that the technology of eavesdropping had become so highly developed that Americans might soon be left with "no place to hide". That day may have arrived. Newsweek has learned that the country's most secret intelligence operation, the national Security Agency, already possesses the computerized equipment to monitor nearly all overseas telephone calls and most domestic and international printed messages.
The agency's devices monitor thousands of telephone circuits, cable lines and the microwave transmissions that carry an increasing share of both spoken and written communications. 
Computers are programmed to watch for "trigger" words or phrases indicating that a message might interest intelligence analysts. When the trigger is pulled, entire messages are tape-recorded or printed out.
That kind of eavesdropping is, however, relatively simple compared with the breakthroughs that lie ahead in the field of snoopery. Already it is technically feasible to "bug" an electric typewriter by picking up its feeble electronic emissions from a remote location and then translating them into words. And some scientists believe that it may be possible in the future for remote electronic equipment to intercept and "read" human brain waves.
Where such capabilities exist, so too does the potential for abuse. It is the old story of technology rushing forward with some new wonder, before the men who supposedly control the machines have figured out how to prevent the machines from controlling them.

oblique 间接的, 不坦率的   eavesdropping 窃听   intercept 中途阻止, 截取

无处藏身 
在上个月的一次访问中，正在调查中央情报局的参议院委员会的主席弗兰克&#8226;丘奇发出了情绪激动，但又拐弯抹角的批评：窃听技术如此发达，美国人可能很快就会“无处藏身”。这一天可能已经到来了。《新闻周刊》了解到，美国最神秘的情报机构，中央情报局，已经拥有了可以监听几乎所有的海外电话通讯和监视大多数国内和国际印刷信息的计算机设备。 
中央情报局的设备监视着成千上万条承担着越来越多的口头和书面通讯的电话线路、电缆线路和微波传输线路。电脑程序监视着那些触发词或短语，这些词或短语表明一条信息可能会引起情报分析员的注意。当一个触发词或短语出现的时候，整个信息就会被录下来或者打印出来。 
然而，与窃探领域即将出现的突破相比，这种形式的窃听是比较简单的。在远处捕捉电动打字机发出的微弱电子信号然后再转换成文字，这样来“窃听”一台电动打字机的方法在技术上已经是可行的了。一些科学家相信，用远处的电子设备截获和“读取”人类的脑电波在将来也是可能的。
如果存在这种能力，也就有被滥用的可能。在本应是机器控制者的人类还没有来得及找到如何阻止机器控制人类之时，科技却突飞猛进，带来新的奇迹，这是一个老生常谈的问题了。


Lesson37 English Education
Polak and I had often very heated discussions about the desirability of giving the children an English education. It has always been my conviction that Indian parents who train their children to think and talk in English from their infancy betray their children and their county. They deprive them of the spiritual and social heritage of the nation, and render them to that extent unfit for the service of the country. 
Having these convictions, I made a point of always talking to my children in Gujarat. Polak never liked this. He thought I was spoiling their future. He contended that, if children were to learn a universal language like English from their infancy, they would easily gain considerable advantage over others in the race of life.
He failed to convince me. I do not now remember whether I convinced him of the correctness of my attitude, or whether he gave me up as too obstinate. This happened about twenty years ago, and my convictions have only deepened with experience. 
Though my sons have suffered for want of full literary education, the knowledge of the mother tongue that they naturally acquired has been all to their and the country's good, inasmuch as they do not appear like the foreigners they would otherwise have appeared. They naturally became bilingual, speaking and writing English with fair ease, because of daily contact with a large circle of English friends, and because of their stay in a country where English was the chief language spoken.

obstinate 倔强的, 顽固的   inasmuch 因...之故, 因为

英语教育 
我和波拉克在是否应该给孩子们英语教育这个问题上经常展开激烈的争论。我一直深信，印度父母如果从小就教育他们的子女用英语思考和讲话是对他们子女和祖国的背叛。他们剥夺了子女得到祖国的精神和社会遗产熏陶的权利，使他们在这个意义上不适合报效祖国。因为有这些信念，我强调要经常用古吉拉特语和孩子们交谈。波拉克不喜欢这样，他认为我这样是在毁掉孩子们的未来。他反驳说，如果孩子们能从小就学习像英语这样一门通用语言，他们很容易就能在生活的竞争中取得相当大的优势。 
他没有能够说服我。到底是我说服他相信了我的态度的正确性，还是他认为我顽固而放弃了要说服我的努力，我现在不记得了。那是大约二十年前的事情了。我的信念随着经历更加坚定了。虽然我的儿子们缺少全面的文学教育，他们自然获得的对自己母语的了解对他们自己和他们的祖国都有好处，因为不这样做的话他们会看起来像外国人，但是他们没有变成那样。他们很自然地就掌握了两门语言，能很轻松地用英语说和写，这是因为他们与一大群英国朋友的日常交往，并且在他们居住的国家里英语是一门主要的口头交流语言。



Lesson38 The Cherokee
Long before the white man came to the Americas, the land belonged only to the Indian. The Cherokee lived in what is now the southeastern part of the United States. They were peace-loving farmers who lived in permanent villages. They built homes and public buildings of brick and stone. They had fine plantations.
When the first white men came, the Cherokee copied many of their ways. One Cherokee scholar, Sequoyah, saw how important reading and writing was to the white man. He decided to make a written form of the spoken Cherokee language. At first he tried to make a sign, or symbol, for each word. But that proved impossible - there were just too many words. Then he took the 85 sounds that made up the Cherokee language. Using his own imagination and an English spelling book, Sequoyah invented a sign for each sound. His alphabet proved amazingly easy to learn. Before long, many Cherokee knew how to read and write in their own language. By 1828, the Cherokee were even printing their own newspaper.
In 1830, the U.S. Congress passed a law. It said the government could remove Indians from their lands. The Cherokee would not go. They had lived on their land for centuries. It belonged to them. Why should they go to a strange land far beyond the Mississippi River?
The army was sent to force the Cherokee out. Soldiers surrounded their villages and marched them west at gunpoint. 
More than 4000 Cherokee died during the terrible march. They called that march "The Trail of Tears." The end of the trail was also the end of the great Cherokee nation.

切罗基人 
远在白人来到美洲之前，印第安人是这片土地的唯一主人。如今美国的东南部曾经是切罗基人居住的地方。切罗基人是热爱和平的农夫，居住在固定的村庄里。他们的家园和公共建筑是用砖和石头建造的。他们拥有美丽的种植园。 
第一批白人来到之后，切罗基人学会了许多白人的生活方式。希考亚是一位切罗基学者，他看到了读和写对白人的重要性，于是决定为切罗基口语创造一种文字。起初他试图为每一个词创造一个符号，但是后来证明这是不可行的&&切罗基语言里有太多的词汇。后来他采纳了组成切罗基语言的八十五个音。借助自己的创造力和一本英语拼写课本，希考亚为每一个音发明了一个符号。令人惊讶的是，他的符号系统非常容易学。没过多久，很多切罗基人就学会了用自己的语言读和写。到一八二八年，切罗基人甚至拥有了自己的报纸。 
1830年，美国议会通过了一项法律，规定政府可以把印第安人从他们居住的土地上赶走。但切罗基人不愿意离开。他们世代居住在这片土地，这片土地属于他们。为什么要让他们迁到密西西比河对岸一片遥远的陌生之地？ 
政府派来了军队，强迫切罗基人迁出。士兵们包围了切罗基人的村庄，用枪口逼着他们向西迁徙。四千多切罗基人死在了残酷的迁徙路途上。他们称这次迁徙为“悲伤之旅”。这条路的尽头也是伟大的切罗基民族的尽头。



Lesson39 Distance Learning
Open learning is a general term for any education or training scheme that tries to make learning available to more people. With open learning, people take responsibility for what they learn, how they learn, where they learn, how quickly they learn, who helps them and how they have their learning assessed.
Distance learning, is a special type of open learning where tutors and learners are far away from each other. This was sometimes called "home-study" or "correspondence courses." 
Originally relying on the postal system, distance learning now uses the computer, satellite and the Internet.
The concept of distance learning is not a new one. The first structured distance learning or correspondence courses were probably the shorthand courses offered by the Pitman organization at the end of the 19th century.
In 1969 the Open University (OU) was created in the UK. This firmly established in the West the principle of access for all to quality education. The idea originally came from the Soviet Union where distance learning had run for many years on a large scale. In the 30 years since the OU was established, an important lesson has been learned.
Distance learners need much more than a tutor who marks assignments and sends them back. Course providers must have excellent administration systems and give their students access to accreditation and qualifications. Many organizations also provide summer schools and social events for students. 
This helps to create a virtual learning community, good for all learners, and especially helpful for students of distance learning.

开放式学习是一个笼统的术语，它指的是能使更多的人得到学习机会的教育或培训计划。通过开放式学习，人们可以控制学习的内容、学习的形式、学习的地点和学习的节奏，选择谁帮助自己学习以及以何种方式评价自己的学习成果。 
远程学习是一种特殊的开放式学习，在这种学习形式下，指导教师和学习者相隔遥远。有时也称为“函授教育”或者“函授课程”。早期的远程学习借助于邮政系统，现在使用的是计算机、卫星和互联网。远程学习并不是一个崭新的概念，最早的远程学习可能是皮特曼组织于十九世纪末开设的速记课程。
1969年，开放式大学在英国诞生了。这在西方牢固地确立了所有人都应该享有素质教育这条原则。这个观念起源于苏联，在那里，大规模的远程教育已经开展了好多年。在开放式大学成立后的30年里，人们得到了一条重要的经验。 
远程学习者需要的远远不只是一位批改作业然后把作业发给学习者的指导教师。提供课程的机构必须有完善的管理系统，能使学习者得到考核并给他们签发证书。许多组织还为学生提供暑期班和社会活动。这有利于建立一个虚拟的学习社区，对所有的学习者都有好处，特别对参加远程学习的学生会有帮助。


Lesson40 Feathered Dinosaur
Two summers ago, a farmer in northeast China was digging in a dried-up lake. He dug up some strange-looking fossilized bones. He wondered: Could these be the remains of ancient dragons?
Not quite. The bones actually belonged to an ancient meat-eating dinosaur named Sinosauropteryx prima. The creature, which was close to the size of a large chicken, lived about 120 million years ago.
Size may not have been the only thing this dinosaur had in common with the chicken. Scientists announced that Sinosauropteryx might have had tiny feathers!
Many scientists had wondered whether some dinosaurs had any feathers. But feathers are so fragile that they usually rot away without a trace. Luckily, the Sinosauropteryx fossils showed a lot of detail. "I had been skeptical of the claim that the dinosaur had feathers," says Canadian scientist Phil Currie. "Boy, was I impressed!"
Not everyone is convinced. Some bird's experts suggest that the feather-like structures may be bits and pieces of scales. 
Whatever they are, they are not the right size and shape for flying. They may have been used to keep the dinosaur warm or help it attract a mate.
When and why feathers first appeared on the earth is just one puzzle scientists hope to solve by studying the area where the fossils were found. "These beds date to a time when modern mammals, flowering plants, and birds were invented," says Alan Brush, bird expert at the University of Connecticut. "The discovery of this site is just as important as going to Mars."

有羽毛的恐龙
两年前，中国东北的一位农民在一个已经干涸的湖床挖地时，挖出了一些样子很奇怪的化石。他想，这是不是古代龙的遗骸呢？ 
并非如此。这些骨头其实是古代一种名叫中华鸟龙的肉食恐龙的化石。中华鸟龙，大小接近一只体型稍大的鸡，生活在距今一亿两千万年前。
身体大小可能不是中华鸟龙和鸡唯一的相似之处。科学家们宣称中华鸟龙可能长有微小的羽毛。 
很多科学家一直在思考恐龙是否长有羽毛。但是羽毛很脆弱，通常很快就腐烂掉，不会留下痕迹。幸运的是，中华鸟龙化石显示了很多这方面的细节。“我过去一直怀疑恐龙长有羽毛这种说法”，加拿大科学家费尔&#8226;贾利说，“哦，这真是令人难忘。”
并不是所有人都相信这一点。有些鸟类专家说这些羽毛状的结构可能是鳞的碎片。不管它们是什么，都不具有适于飞行的尺寸和形状，可能是用来保暖或者增加吸引配偶的魅力。 
科学家们通过研究发现这些化石的地方，希望能找到羽毛最早什么时候和为什么在地球上出现这个谜题的答案。“这些湖床可以追溯到现代哺乳动物、有花植物和鸟类最早出现的年代”，康涅狄格大学的鸟类专家艾伦&#8226;布鲁斯说，“发现这个遗址的重要性相当于探索火星。”


Lesson41 Speech by President Bush on the Loss of Space Shuttle Columbia
My fellow Americans, this day has brought terrible news and great sadness to our country. At 9:00 this morning, Mission Control in Houston has lost contact with the Space Shuttle Columbia. A short time later, debris was seen falling from the skies above Texas. The Columbia was lost: there are no survivors.
All Americans today are thinking, as well, of the families of these men and women who have been given this sudden shock and grief. You're not alone. Our entire nation grieves with you. And those you loved will always have the respect and gratitude of this country.
The cause in which they died will continue. Mankind is led into the darkness beyond our world by the inspiration of discovery and the longing to understand. Our journey into space will go on. In the skies today we saw destruction and tragedy. Yet farther than we can see is comfort and hope. In the words of the prophet Isaiah, "Lift your eyes and look to the heavens. Who created all these? He， who brings out the starry hosts one by one and calls them each by name. Because of His great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing."
The same creator who names the stars also knows the names of the seven souls we mourn today. The crew of the shuttle Columbia did not return safely to Earth; yet we can pray that all are safely home. May God bless the grieving families, and may God continue to bless America.

美国总统布什就“哥伦比亚”号航天飞机失事发表的讲话
我的美国同胞们，今天传来噩耗，巨大的悲痛降临我们的国家。今早九点钟，位于休斯敦的航天地面指挥中心同我们的“哥伦比亚”号航天飞机失去了联系。此后不久，便发现得克萨斯州的上空有残骸飘落。“哥伦比亚”号失事，无一人生还。
今天所有美国人都牵挂着经受了这种突如其来的打击和悲伤的男女宇航员的家人们。你们并不孤单，我们全体国民同你们一起哀悼他们。你们所爱的人将永远受到这个国家的尊重和感激。
他们为之献身的事业仍将继续。人类正是在探索精神和求知欲望的引导下，超越我们的世界，进入到黑暗的外层空间。我们的太空之旅仍将继续。
在今天的天空中，我们目睹了毁灭和悲剧。然而，在我们看不到的远方，有着慰藉与希望。用预言家以赛亚的话说：“抬起眼睛，仰望天空。是谁创造了这一切?是造物主创造了点点繁星，并将其逐个命名。由于他的伟大才智与神奇力量，才无一遗漏。”
给群星命名的造物主也知道我们今天缅怀的七位亡灵的名字。“哥伦比亚”号航天飞机的机组人员虽未平安地返回地球，但我们能祈祷他们均已安息。愿上帝保佑这些悲伤的家属，愿上帝继续保佑美国。


Lesson42 The Crippled Butterfly
A man found a cocoon of a butterfly. One day a small opening appeared. He sat and watched the butterfly for several hours as it struggled to force its body through that little hole. Then it seemed to stop making any progress. It appeared as if it had gotten as far as it could and it could go no farther. So, the man decided to help the butterfly. 
He took a pair of scissors and snipped off the remaining bit of the cocoon. The butterfly then emerged easily, but it had a swollen body, and small shrivelled wings. He continued to watch the butterfly, because he expected that the wings would enlarge and expand to support the body, which would fly up in time.
The flight never happened! In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling around with a swollen body and shrivelled wings. It was never able to fly. what he had done in his well intentioned kindness and haste, what he did not understand was that the restricting cocoon and the struggle required to get through the tiny opening were God's way of forcing fluid from the body of the butterfly into its wings so that it would be ready for flight once it achieved its freedom from the cocoon.
Sometimes, struggles are exactly what we need in our life. If God allowed us to go through our life without any obstacles, it would cripple us. We would not be as strong as we could have been, and we could never fly.

残废的蝴蝶 
一个人发现了一只蝴蝶的茧。有一天，茧上出现了一条小裂缝。他坐下来，花了好几个小时观看蝴蝶从小裂缝里艰难地往外爬。后来蝴蝶好像停了下来，再没有任何进展。似乎它已经尽力了，再也爬不动了。于是，这个人决定帮蝴蝶一把。 
他拿来一把剪刀，剪开了茧的剩余部分。蝴蝶很容易地就爬了出来，但是却是身体臃肿，带着小而干瘪的翅膀。他继续观察着这只蝴蝶，希望它的翅膀能够长大到足以支撑它的身体，最终可以展翅飞翔。
然而，蝴蝶没有能够飞起来。事实上，这只蝴蝶的一辈子只能拖着臃肿的身体和萎缩的翅膀爬来爬去。它丧失了飞行的能力。 
虽然他是好意，但是行动太草率。他不知道的是，束缚蝴蝶的茧和蝴蝶从茧的微小缝隙里挣扎着爬出来的过程是上天设计来迫使液体从蝴蝶的体内流向它的翅膀的方法，这样蝴蝶一旦从茧里爬出来，就可以展翅飞翔了。 
有时候，奋争正是我们的生活中所必需的。如果上天要我们的一生没有任何艰难险阻，那只会严重损害我们。那样我们将不能拥有我们应有的强壮，就永远不会飞翔。


Lesson43 Martin Luther King, Jr.: "I Have a Dream"
I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.
Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. 
This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.
But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.
And when this happens, when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:
Free at last! Free at last!
Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!

马丁&#8226;路德&#8226;金：我有一个梦
1936年8月28日于华盛顿特区林肯纪念堂
今天，我很高兴地同大家一起，参加这次将成为我国历史上为了争取自由而举行的最伟大的示威集会。
一百年前，一位伟大的美国人签署了《解放宣言》, 
今天我们就是在他的雕像前聚会。这一庄严宣言犹如灯塔的光芒，给千百万在那摧残生命的不义之火中受煎熬的黑奴带来了希望。它之到来犹如欢乐的黎明，结束了桎梏黑人的漫漫长夜。
然而，一百年后的今天，我们必须正视黑人还没有得到自由这一悲惨的事实。一百年后的今天，在种族隔离的镣铐和种族歧视的枷锁下，黑人的生活依然凄惨不堪。一百年后的今天，黑人仍生活在物质充裕的海洋中一个贫穷的孤岛上。一百年后的今天，黑人仍然萎缩在美国社会的角落里，并且意识到自己是故土家园的流亡者。今天我们在这里集会，就是要描述这些骇人听闻的情况。
当我们让自由之声响起来，当我们让自由之声从每一个大小村庄，每一个州和每一个城市响起来时，我们将能够加速这一天的到来。这一天，上帝的所有儿女，黑人和白人，犹太教徒和非犹太教徒，新教徒和天主教徒，都将手携手，合唱一首古老的黑人灵歌：
终于自由啦！终于自由啦！
感谢全能的上帝，我们终于自由啦！


Lesson44 Can War Be Abolished?
Is it possible to persuade mankind to live without war? War is an ancient institution which has existed for at least six thousand years. It was always wicked and usually foolish, but in the past the human race managed to live with it. Modern ingenuity has changed this. Either Man will abolish war, or war will abolish Man. For the present, it is nuclear weapons that cause the gravest danger, but bacteriological or chemical weapons may, before long, offer an even greater threat. If we succeed in abolishing nuclear weapons, our work will not be done. It will never be done until we have succeeded in abolishing war. To do this, we need to persuade mankind to look upon international questions in a new way, not as contests of force, in which the victory goes to the side which is most skilful in massacre, but by arbitration in accordance with agreed principles of law. It is not easy to change age-old mental habits, but this is what must be attempted.
There are those who say that the adoption of this or that ideology would prevent war. I believe this to be a profound error. All ideologies are based upon dogmatic assertions which are, at best, doubtful, and at worst, totally false. Their adherents believe in them so fanatically that they are willing to go to war in support of them.

ingenuity 机灵；独创性   bacteriological 细菌的   massacre 屠杀

战争能被废除吗？
有没有可能说服人类放弃战争而生存？战争是一种古老的制度，至少已经存在了六千年。战争总是邪恶的，且通常是荒谬的，但在过去人类还是努力地与之共存。现代人的智慧已经改变了这一切。要么人类废除战争，要么战争毁掉人类。现在引发极度危险的是核武器，但不久后生物或化学武器会带来更严重的威胁。如果成功销毁核武器，我们的工作还未完成。直到我们成功地废除了战争，这一任务才算完成。为了废除战争，我们需要说服人类用新的方式看待国际问题，不是将其视为武力的竞赛，赢家是最擅长屠杀的一方，而是依照大家约定的法则来仲裁解决。改变古老的思维习惯不易，但这是必须要尝试的。
有些人认为采用这种或那种意识形态会防止战争的发生。我认为这是个严重的错误。所有的意识形态都是以武断的主张为基础的，往好里说，这些意识形态令人生疑，往坏里说，是完全错误的。追随者对其如此狂热的信奉，以至于为了支持它们而愿意去发动战争。


Lesson45 The Parable of the Mule
Once there was a farmer who owned an old mule. One day the mule fell into the farmer's well. After carefully assessing the situation, the farmer sympathized with the mule, but decided that neither the mule nor the well was worth the trouble of saving. Instead, he called his neighbours together, told them what had happened and enlisted them to help haul dirt to bury the old mule in the well and put him out of his misery.
　　Initially, the old mule was hysterical. But as the farmer and his neighbours continued shovelling and the dirt hit his back, a thought struck him. It dawned on him that every time a shovel load of dirt landed on his back he could shake it off and step up. This he did, blow after blow.
"Shake it off and step up... shake it off and step up... shake it off and step up!" He repeated this to encourage himself.　　
No matter how painful the blows, or how distressing the situation seemed, the old mule just kept right on shaking it off and stepping up.
It wasn't long before the old mule, battered and exhausted, stepped triumphantly over the wall of that well! What seemed like a burial actually saved him...all because of the manner in which the mule handled his adversity.
　　That's life. If we face our problems and respond to them positively, and refuse to give in to panic, bitterness, or self-pity ...The adversities that come along to bury us usually have within them real potential to benefit us.

骡子的寓言
从前，农夫有一头骡子。一天，骡子掉进了农夫的井里。仔细估量了形势后，农夫虽然很同情骡子，他还是判定不管是骡子还是井都不值得挽救了。他把邻居们召集起来，告诉了他们所发生的一切，并要他们帮忙运土把老骡子埋在井里，使它不再痛苦。
开始，老骡子有点歇斯底里。但是当农夫和他的邻居们继续铲土并且土不断地打在骡子背上的时候，骡子突然想到了一个主意。他意识到，他可以把落在背上的每一锨土抖下来，踩在脚下，自己就可以站高一点。他这样做了，土一锨锨的砸下来。
“抖下来，站高一点...抖下来，站高一点...抖下来，站高一点！”他不断地重复着来激励自己。
不管土打在背上有多痛，不管形势是多么令人痛苦，老骡子坚持不懈地把土抖下来，站高一点。
没过多久，遍体鳞伤、精疲力尽的老骡子成功地从井里走了出来。看似葬礼的一件事居然救了他，这都是因为他以一种不同的方式来应对苦难。
这就是生活。如果我们能面对我们的问题并以积极的态度来应对，而不屈服于惊慌、悲伤或者自怜... 
我们其实可以从看起来会埋葬我们的苦难中受益。



Lesson46 Tigers
Tigers are found in India and most of the countries of South-east Asia. They live in forests and grassy plains, where there are plenty of other animals for them to hunt for food. 
If you see a tiger in the zoo, you may think its coat is brightly collared and easily seen, but in the jungles and grassland where it lives, a tiger is hard to see. The sunlight, shining through leaves and branches, makes patches of bright light and shadow. A tiger's golden collared coat mixes so well into these patches of sunlight and shadow that it is not easily seen. When it walks through the long forest grass, it is also hard to see, for its hair is the same colour as the blades of yellowish grass and patches of deep shadow.
　　This camouflage, as we call it, is very important, because tigers are hunters and catch other animals for their food. If the animals could see a tiger coming, they would quickly escape. It has strong, sharp teeth which it uses for seizing and eating the animals it catches. A tiger's chief food is deer, wild pigs, monkeys and other small animals, but it will also kill cows. A tiger is also very strong and if it kills a deer or a cow, it will often drag the dead animal several hundred yards to the shelter of some bushes, where it can eat its meal in peace. Tigers usually hunt and eat at night, and during the daytime they lie resting, hidden in the long grass.

camouflage 伪装

老虎 
老虎生活在印度和大多数的东南亚国家。它们生活在森林里和草原上，那里有丰富的猎物供它们捕食。在动物园里见到老虎，你可能认为它们的皮毛颜色亮丽，很容易被发现，但是在它们所生活的丛林里和草地上，老虎是很难被发现的。阳光穿过树叶和树枝，使光亮和阴影斑驳交错。老虎的金黄色皮毛与这些光亮和阴影很好地融合在一起，使它们很难被发现。老虎走在深深的森林草丛里，也很难被发现，因为老虎的毛发与浅黄色草叶和深色阴影交错的颜色是一样的。 
这种我们所说的伪装是非常重要的，因为老虎是猎手，靠捕猎其他动物为食。如果猎物看到老虎来了，它们就会快速地逃离。老虎长着坚硬锋利的牙齿，用来抓住和咬食捕捉到的猎物。老虎主要的食物是鹿、野猪、猴子和其他小动物，但是也会捕食牛。老虎非常强壮，杀死鹿或牛后，老虎通常会将猎物的尸体拖到几百码外的树丛隐蔽处，然后安静地进食。老虎通常在晚上捕猎和进食，白天它们躲在深深的草丛里休息。



Lesson47 The History of Money
Today, our currency is a mixture of coins and paper money, but it wasn't always that way. Before metal coins and paper bills existed, people used a lot of unusual things to buy what they needed. In one part of the world, for example, people used sharks' teeth for money. In some places, brightly collored feathers and rare seashells were money.
No one knows for sure when people started using metal coins for money. Archaeologists have found coins dating from 600 B.C., so we know they have been around for a long time. At first, people used precious metals, such as gold and silver, to make coins.
In the 1200s, people in China used iron coins for their currency. These coins weren't worth very much, so people had to use a lot of them to make their purchases. Because it was inconvenient to carry around a large number of heavy iron coins, the government started printing paper receipts. People took these receipts to banks and traded them in for coins. 
This is the first example we have of paper money.
Today, most countries use a mixture of coins and paper bills for their currency. In the United States, the paper bills are all the same size and colour. For example, the one-dollar bill is the same size and colour as the one-hundred-dollar bill. In many other countries, the bills come in various sizes and colours. The smaller sized bills are worth less money. This makes it easier for people to tell the value of their money at a glance.

archaeologist 考古学家

货币的历史 
今天，我们的货币包括硬币和纸币，但并不一直都是这样的。在金属硬币和纸币出现前，人们用许多稀奇的东西来购买他们需要的物品。例如，世界上有个地方的人用鲨鱼牙齿作货币。在有些地方，艳丽多彩的羽毛和罕见的贝壳被当做货币。 
没人确切的知道人们从何时起开始使用金属硬币作为货币。考古学家称发现过可追溯到公元前600年的硬币，我们因此知道这些货币已经出现很长时间了。最初，人们用稀有金属，如金子和银子制造硬币。 
公元1200年，中国人使用铁币作货币。这种硬币价值低，所以买东西时，人们不得不用很多货币。因为携带大量沉重的铁币出行不方便，政府开始印制纸质收据。人们带这些收据到银行，再把它们兑换成硬币。这就是最早的纸币。 
当今，大多数国家使用硬币和纸币两种作为货币。美国纸币的尺寸和颜色都一样。例如，1美元纸币的大小和色彩与100美元的一模一样。在其他很多国家，纸币的尺寸和色彩很不一样。尺寸小一些的纸币，币值就小。这使人们一眼就能看出纸币的面额。


Lesson48 Credit and Modern Consumers
　Credit is now being promoted and advertised as never before. People are being persuaded to buy money and then being told by other advertisements what to spend it on. Banks and Building Societies are at the forefront of this onslaught, heedless of the effect of personal debt on the social fabric and the balance of payments and a laissez-faire government refuses to take any responsibility. Artificial needs and desires are being foisted upon us and, because of the employment of evermore sophisticated techniques, we are beginning to believe that they are natural and immutable.
　　We now have to contend with junk mail, telephone selling and even cold visits by sales representatives to our homes in the evening. There is a new and thriving market for "luxury" goods, often bought on credit, naturally, with the manufacturers of glassware, china, jewellery and leather-bound books promoting their products and the associated "lifestyle" all over the place.
Designer labels have acquired special status and emanated a kind of religious aura. Any pair of jeans will not do; it has to be a pair with the correct label. Not only have we been transmogrified into habitual consumers, but we are increasingly defining ourselves and each other in terms of objects. We have become commodity fetishists. Images of consumers in adverts are largely stereotypes; they have to stand for categories of people in order to strike a bond of identification with as many of us as possible.

forefront 最前部；最前线    onslaught 冲击   heedless　不注意的；不顾
laissez faire 放任；自由主义   foist　硬卖给；把...强加   evermore 始终
emanate　散发；发出   transmogrify  使变形；使改变   fetishist 物神崇拜者

信用与现代消费者 
过去从未像现在这样大力提倡和宣传信用。人们被说服去购买金钱，然后又被其他广告告知用钱买什么。银行和建房互助会站在这场冲击波的最前沿，无视个人欠债对社会结构和支付平衡的影响，而一个采取放任主义的政府不愿对此承担任何责任。人造的需求和欲望正强加给我们。因为使用的技术始终很深奥，我们开始相信这些需求是自然的和不可改变的。 
我们现在不得不应付垃圾邮件、电话销售，甚至是销售代表们的强行登门夜访。新生而繁荣的“奢侈品”市场，通常以信用支付，自然到处都是玻璃器具、瓷器、珠宝和皮边儿书籍的制造商们在推销他们的产品以及与其紧密联系的“生活方式”。 
设计师标牌已经获得了特殊地位，并发出一种带宗教色彩的光环。不是随意一条牛仔裤都行，必须是一条有正确标牌的牛仔裤。我们不但已经被改变为习惯性消费者，而且我们越来越根据物品来定义自己和别人。我们已经开始盲目迷恋商品。广告里的消费者形象大多是模式化的，他们必须代表各个类型的人，以便让尽可能多的人形成认同。


Lesson49 The Jonker Diamond
Jacobus Jonker was a diamond prospector in South Africa. He never really had much luck, and the longer he prospected, the less he believed in ever making his fortune. Imagine his feelings, then, when he found one of the biggest diamonds in the world - right in his own back yard! There had been a heavy rainstorm, and the rains had washed away part of a hillside behind his house. And in the middle of the mud sat a huge diamond. Jonker sold the stone to a diamond dealer for a pretty penny - over three hundred thousand dollars! In New York, the diamond was resold - this time for almost eight hundred thousand dollars!
The true value of a diamond is never known until it has been cut. Once cut successfully, its value can increase a thousand times. It's easy to understand why the owner of the Jonker diamond went to the best diamond cutter he knew. Kaplan, the cutter, studied the diamond for twelve whole months. When he felt he was ready to start work, he discovered a flaw. He had to begin his calculations all over again - otherwise he might have destroyed the stone. Kaplan continued to study the stone; six more months passed. Finally, Kaplan said to the owner, "I'm ready to start my work. There will be one exquisite diamond that will be comparable to any in the world, and eleven small diamonds of first-class quality."
Kaplan waited a few more days until he felt he was in the best physical and mental condition possible. One mistake could lead to the total destruction of the stone. He picked up his tools and held his breath as he made the first blow. The diamond split exactly as he had promised.

杨克钻石 
雅克布?杨克是南非的一位钻石勘探家。他的运气一直都不好。勘探的时间越长，他越不相信自己有一天会发财。试想一下当他就在自家后院发现世界上最大的钻石之一时的感受！一场暴风雨冲走了他屋后的一部分山坡。一颗硕大的钻石就出现在泥土中。
杨克把钻石卖给了一位钻石商人，他卖了个好价钱，30多万美元！这颗钻石在纽约被再次出售，售价几乎达到了80万美元！ 
一颗钻石在切割前是无法知道其真正价值的。一旦切割成功，钻石的价值就会增加一千倍。这就不难理解为什么这块杨克钻石的主人要去找他所知的最好的钻石切割师。切割师名叫卡普兰，他花了整整12个月来仔细研究这颗钻石。正当他感到可以开始工作的时候，他发现了一个瑕疵。他不得不重新开始计算&&否则可能会毁掉钻石。卡普兰继续研究这块钻石。又过了6个月。卡普兰终于对钻石的主人说：“我可以开始工作了，完成之后你会看到一颗堪与世界上任何钻石相媲美的精美钻石和十一颗质量上乘的小钻石。” 
卡普兰又等了几天，直到他感觉自己处于最好的身体和精神状态。稍有差池就将完全毁掉这颗钻石。他操起工具，屏住呼吸，敲下了第一锤。钻石裂开了，正像他承诺的那样。


Lesson50 On the Origin of Middle Class
The rise of the merchant class was intimately linked with the growth of towns and trade; that is to say that they were linked with the most dynamic element in medieval European civilization and one hostile to its feudal setting. It was an element which not only produced new wealth but new institutions. Feudal institutions did not work easily in a society of tradesmen and craftsmen for which they had no adequate theoretical place. Yet feudal lords sought the support of towns against kings and kings sought the support of townsmen and their wealth against overmighty subjects. They gave towns charters and privileges. The walls which surrounded the medieval city were often the symbol and guarantee of its immunity. #The air of a town makes you free# said a German proverb. The communes and within them the guilds were associations of free men for a long time isolated in a world unfree. The burgher - the bourgeois, the dweller in bourg or borough - was a man who stood up for himself in a universe of dependence.This salient characteristic of the new middle class is echoed today by the former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, when she refers to the danger posed by a "nanny state" in its propensity to encourage dependency among the population.

论中产阶级的起源 
商人阶层的出现与市镇和贸易的发展紧密相关；也就是说他们与中世纪欧洲文明中最有活力的因素和反对其所处的封建环境的因素有关联。这种因素不仅产生新的财富，而且产生新的制度。封建制度在一个商人和手工业社会中很难发挥作用，因为它们在理论上就没有合适的位置。然而封建领主寻求市镇的支持来反对国王，国王则寻求市民和他们的财富的支持以对抗这些势力强大的臣民。他们给予市镇特许状和特权。环绕中世纪城市的城墙通常是市镇豁免权的象征和保证。一条德国谚语说“市镇里的空气让你自由”。市镇和自治体里的行会是长时期孤立于一个不自由的世界里的自由人的协会组织。商人&&资产阶级，自治城镇的居民&&是在一个无独立的世界里捍卫自己利益的人。
时至今日，前英国首相玛格丽特&#8226;撒切尔在提到“保姆国家”倾向于鼓励人们的依赖性而带来的危险时，重新提到了这一新中产阶级的突出特征。



Lesson51 Dolphins
Some people think that dolphins have a real language and that if we could learn their language; we could eventually start talking to them and discussing the important news of the day. 
Sadly, this is only a dream. They may have very big brains and they may make lots of strange noises, but they do not, if we are honest about it, have a true language. It is nice to think they do, but it is simply not the case.They do, however, have a very special talent for using their noises to find their way about the oceans and to locate shoals of fish. This is a kind of sonar - an echo-location system. What happens is that the dolphin swims along, chirping and squeaking, and these very high-pitched sounds spread through the water until they hit some solid object. Then the sound-waves bounce back to the dolphin. The animal can tell how far away the object is by checking how long it takes for the sound to reach him. This feature of sound detection is copied by human beings onto some devices used in submarines, helping them to locate objects and avoid collisions.
With all its special qualities, it is easy to see why we find the dolphin so attractive. It has graceful movement, it is intelligent, it is helpful to those in trouble, it has a playful character and it has a face that always looks happy. 
These are all qualities we admire in human beings, so it is not surprising that we are so fond of the dolphin.

海豚
有些人认为海豚有真正的语言，如果能学会它们的语言，我们就能最终和它们交谈，谈论当今重要的新闻。可惜的是，这只是一个梦想。海豚拥有很大的大脑，能够发出许多奇怪的声音，但是老实讲，它们并不拥有真正的语言。能这样认为固然不错，但这不是事实。
然而，海豚确实有特殊的才能，可以利用它们发出的声音在大海里探路和确定鱼群的位置。这是一种声纳装置，一种回声定位系统。具体来讲，海豚边游动边发出嘁嘁喳喳的声音，这些音调很高的声音在水里传播，碰上坚硬的物体后，声波就返回到了海豚。通过声音返回所需的时间，海豚就能确定物体有多远。人类模仿海豚这种声音探测的特征发明了一些潜水艇用的定位和避免碰撞的装置。
海豚具有如此多独特的品质，那就不难理解它为什么那么惹人喜爱了。它动作优雅，聪明伶俐，乐于帮助处于危难之中的人，它生性好玩，还有一张看上去总是很快乐的脸。这些都是我们人类崇尚的品质，所以我们如此喜欢海豚就一点也不奇怪了。


Lesson52 Happy Vacation
Of course you do not want to spend your vacation sick in bed. So what can you do to stay in good health while travelling? There are three things you should remember when you travel: relax, sleep and eat well.
A vacation is supposed to be a time for relaxing but very often it is not. Think about what you do when you are a tourist. There are so many places to visit: museums, shops, parks and churches. You may spend most days walking around these places. This can be very tiring. Do not ask your body to do too much. A tired body means a weak body. And a weak body gets sick easily. So sit down for a few hours in a nice spot. In good weather, look for a quiet park bench.
Sleep is also important. If you want to stay healthy you need to get enough sleep. Your hotel room may be noisy or the bed may be uncomfortable. You may not get enough sleep for other reasons. You may want to stay out late at night. Then you should plan to sleep for an hour during the day. That extra hour can make a big difference.
Finally, if you want to stay healthy, you must eat well. That means eating the right kinds of food. Your body needs fresh fruits and vegetables, and some meat, milk or cheese.
So, remember this: if you want to enjoy your vacation, take good care of yourself. Give your body some rest. Get enough sleep and eat good, healthy food.

欢乐假日
你当然不愿意以卧病在床的形式度过假期。那么在旅行时如何保持身体健康呢？旅行时有三点你应该牢记在心：放松、睡好、吃好。 
假日应该是放松身心的时候，但事实经常并非如此。回想一下你作为一名游客的经历。有好多地方要去参观：博物馆、商店、公园、教堂。大部分的时日都穿梭于这些地点之间。这是很累人的，不要让你的身体如此疲惫。疲惫的身体是虚弱的，而虚弱的身体很容易生病。所以要在一个宜人的景点坐下来休息几个小时。如果是个好天气，也可以找个公园里的凳子坐下来。 
睡眠也很重要。要想身体健康，要有足够的睡眠。宾馆的房间可能很吵，或者床很不舒服。可能会有其他的原因使你无法获得足够的睡眠。你可能晚上要熬夜。那么你应该计划好在白天睡上一个小时。这额外的一小时睡眠很重要。
最后，要想保持身体健康，你必须吃好。也就是说，吃的食物要合适。你的身体需要新鲜的水果和蔬菜、一些肉类、牛奶或者奶酪。
所以，要记住，要想拥有一个快乐的假日，一定要照顾好你自己。要让你的身体得到休息，要有充分的睡眠，要吃合适的健康食物。



Lesson53 The Appreciation of Good Literature
When one reads a number of good authors and feels that one author describes things very vividly, that another shows great tenderness of delicacy, a third expresses things exquisitely, a fourth has an indescribable charm, a fifth one's writing is like good whiskey, a sixth one's is like mellow wine, he should not be afraid to say that he likes them and appreciates them, if only his appreciation is genuine. After such a wide experience in reading, he has the proper experiential basis for knowing what are mildness, mellowness, strength, power, brilliance, pungency, delicacy, and charm. When he has tasted all these flavours, then he knows what is good literature without reading a single handbook.
The first rule of a student of literature is to learn to sample different flavours. The best flavour is mildness and mellowness, but is most difficult for a writer to attain. Between mildness and mere flatness there is only a very thin margin.A writer whose thoughts lack depth and originality may try to write a simple style and end up by being insipid. Only fresh fish may be cooked in its own juice; stale fish must be flavoured with anchovy sauce and pepper and mustard - the more the better.
A good writer is like the sister of Yang Kueifei, who could go to see the Emperor himself without powder and rouge. All the other beauties in the palace required them. This is the reason why there are so few writers who dare to write in simple English.

exquisitely 精致地   mellowness 醇厚   pungency 辛辣
anchovy sauce 鱼鲜味酱油   insipid 索然无味的

文学作品的欣赏 
当人们阅读了许多优秀作家的作品后，就会感到有的作家描写生动，有的作家细腻，第三位作家表达精致，第四位作家有难以言表的魅力， 
第五位作家犹如陈年威士忌， 第六位作家犹如醇厚的老窖，只要他的感受是真实的， 
他就只管大胆地这样说出来好了。有了这样广泛阅读的基础， 他就有了亲身经历的基础， 知道什么是柔和，醇厚，刚强，力量， 
聪明，辛辣，细腻和魅力。 当他尝遍了这些味道，不用读任何教科书，他就学会了如何判断优秀作品。 
文学学生的第一条规则是学会品尝各种滋味。最佳的滋味是柔和和醇厚，但这对作家来说是最难达到的境地。在柔和与平淡无味之间只隔着薄薄的一层纸。 
没有思想深度和创造性的作家可能试图写得柔和些，但结果常常是使作品味同嚼蜡。只有清水煮鲜鱼才能出佳味，烂鱼就一定得多用鱼鲜酱油，辣椒和芥末&&而且是多多益善。 
好作家犹如杨贵妃，不用涂脂抹粉就可去见皇上。而其他宫中美人却少不得胭脂，这就是为什么很少有作家敢用简单的语言写作的道理。


Lesson54 The Press in the US
The press in the United States produces a wide variety of printed media, possible more than in any other country. There is a publication for almost every subject, from national news to more specialized subjects like industries, sports and even hobbies. Some of the most important publications are the national newspapers because of their broad coverage and wide circulation. The press's role in circulating daily news is very important to the everyday lives of the people, but it plays another, perhaps more important role as well. As in many other democratic countries, the press is the watchdog of the American political process.
The most important publications are the daily newspapers, a few of which have very high status. The most prominent among these is probably the Washington Post. Because the Post is published out of Washington, D.C., the nation's capital, it probably has the very best coverage of the national-level political scene.
On the business side, the most important publication is probably the Wall Street Journal, published in New York, America's business capital. The Journal, with its very strong business orientation, is a very conservative paper but it is careful not to take side politically.
But there are many other publications with very strong political orientations. Two examples of this are the two most widely circulated news weeklies, Newsweek and Time. Although these are both weekly news magazines reporting on a wide range of subjects, political, cultural and business, they are on opposite political sides. Time is a more liberal publication, generally supporting the Democratic Party, while Newsweek is conservatively oriented, supporting the Republicans.

prominent 显著的, 突出的

美国的新闻界 
在美国的新闻界，印刷媒体的种类众繁多，可能超过其他任何国家。从全国性的新闻到更专业化的领域，像工业、体育、甚至业余爱好，几乎每一个领域都有出版物。全国性的报纸属于最重要的出版物，因为其覆盖面广、发行量大。新闻界传播每天新闻，这对人们的日常生活非常重要，但是它还有一个更重要的作用。就像在其他民主国家一样，美国新闻界是国内政治活动的监督者。 
最重要的出版物是日报，有些具有很高的地位。《华盛顿邮报》可能是最著名的日报了。因为《华盛顿邮报》在美国的首都华盛顿特区出版，它能够很好地报道国家的政治动态。 
在商业方面，最重要的出版物是《华尔街日报》。华尔街日报出版于美国的经济首都纽约，该报具有很强的商业倾向，是一份很保守的报纸，它很小心在政治上不偏向于任何一方。 
但是很多其他的出版物都带有强烈的政治倾向。两份发行量最大的新闻周刊，《新闻周刊》和《时代周刊》就是这方面很好的例子。虽然两者都是每周出版的新闻杂志，都广泛报道政治、文化、商业等各方面的内容，它们有着相反的政治立场。《时代周刊》倾向于自由主义，一般支持民主党；而《新闻周刊》政治上保守，支持共和党。



Lesson55 Potatoes
In many parts of the world, particularly in Northern Europe and North America, people eat a lot of potatoes. Like many important foods, it was introduced to England from North America at the time of Queen Elizabeth. Nowadays it is such an important part of the Englishman's diet that it is difficult to imagine how he used to manage without it.
Potatoes can be cooked in many different ways. The four main methods used in England are boiling, baking, roasting and frying.
When one boils a potato one cuts it up and cooks it in a saucepan with boiling water and a little salt. They usually take twenty minutes or half an hour to cook.Potatoes are also baked. They are put in an oven for about half an hour. Usually they are not peeled. Baked potatoes with their skins on are called potatoes in their jackets.
Roasting is like baking because it is usually done in an oven. The main difference between baking and roasting is that when baking one does not use fat, but in roasting one does. For their Sunday lunch many English people usually have roast beef with roast potatoes.
Frying is like roasting because fat or oil is used but one does not use an oven. There are two main ways of frying potatoes. One can cut them into slices and fry them in a special shallow pan called a frying pan. The other way is called deep frying. The slices of potatoes are put into a deep pan or metal box full of oil. This is like boiling except that one uses oil instead of water.

土豆 
在世界的很多地方，特别是北欧和北美，人们食用大量的土豆。如同其他重要的食物一样，土豆在伊丽莎白时期从北美传入英国。如今，土豆已经成为了英国人饮食中非常重要的一部分，所以很难想象在土豆传入之前英国人是怎么生活的。
烹饪土豆的方式很多。在英国四种主要的方式是煮、烤、烧和炸。
煮土豆时，把土豆切好，放入盛有沸水的烧锅里，加入一点盐。通常要煮上20分钟或半个小时。
也可以烤土豆。把土豆放在烤箱里大约半个小时。通常烤土豆是不剥皮的。不剥皮烤出来的土豆称为带皮的土豆。
烧和烤很相似，通常也是在烤箱里完成。烧和烤的主要区别在于烤的时候不放油，而烧的时候是要用油的。很多英国人通常都拿烧牛肉和烧土豆作为星期天的午餐。
炸与烧很相似，要放油脂或者油，但是炸的时候是不用烤箱的。有两种炸土豆的方法，一种方法是把土豆切成片，放在一种称为煎锅的浅底锅里炸。另外一种方法称为深炸，把土豆片放到盛满油的深锅或金属锅里炸，这很像煮，不过用的是油而不是水。



Lesson56 Smoking Facts and Figures
　Many people, including doctors, parents, teachers, and others, are concerned about the health risks of cigarette smoking. According to the latest statistics, active smoking kills 400,000 smokers in the United States each year, and secondhand smoke kills 53,000 nonsmokers in the United States each year. Equally disturbing is the fact that 80% of smokers have their first cigarette before they are 18 years old.
Before trying to solve the health problems related to cigarette smoking, an important question to ask is why people start smoking to begin with. Some factors involved in beginning to smoke are environmental. For example, family history influences whether or not a child becomes a smoker. 
When parents smoke, they model smoking behaviour, and children often copy what they see their parents do. Many people, especially young people, have their first cigarette because of peer pressure. They want to be accepted in their social group, and if smoking is part of the group's activities, young people will begin to smoke in order to be accepted into the group.
Personal factors also affect whether a person will begin to smoke. People with tendencies toward risk-taking behaviour are more likely to start smoking than people who tend not to take risks. Outgoing people are also more likely to become smokers than shy people are. People also take up smoking to alleviate stress, or to help themselves lose weight. Finally, people, especially young people, begin to smoke because they believe smoking makes them appear mature, self-confident, and independent.
When we understand the reasons why people become smokers, we can help smokers become nonsmokers again. We can also help nonsmokers remain lifetime nonsmokers.

alleviate 减轻

有关抽烟的事实和数字
　　包括医生、父母、老师在内的许多人都很关注抽烟给健康带来的危害。最新的统计数据表明，在美国，每年主动吸烟导致四十万吸烟者的死亡，被动吸烟导致五万三千名不抽烟人的死亡。同样令人不安的一个事实是，百分之八十的吸烟者是在十八岁之前开始抽第一支烟的。
　　要想解决与吸烟有关的健康问题，首先要问的一个重要问题是为什么人们会开始吸烟。导致开始吸烟的部分原因是环境因素。例如，家庭吸烟史会影响到孩子是否会成为一名吸烟者。父母吸烟的话，他们成了抽烟行为的模仿对象，孩子们经常会模仿他们父母的行为。许多人，特别是年轻人，他们开始抽烟是因为来自同伴的压力。青年人希望能被自己的社会群体认可。如果抽烟是这个群体的活动的一部分，他们就会开始抽烟以加入这个群体。
　　个人因素也会影响一个人是否会开始抽烟。有冒险倾向的人比不愿冒险的人开始抽烟的可能性要大。外向型性格的人比害羞的人更容易成为一名吸烟者。有些人开始抽烟是为了减轻压力，或者帮助减肥。最后，有些人，特别是青年人开始抽烟是因为他们相信抽烟使他们显得成熟、自信和独立。
　　我们了解了为什么人们会成为吸烟者后，就可以帮助吸烟者戒烟，也可以帮助不抽烟的人一辈子都不抽烟。


Lesson57 Value of Praise
　Sister Mroslas, in 1962, was a teacher at St. Mary's School in Morris, Minnesota.
One of her students was called Eklund and he was handful. He often got in trouble. But Sister Mroslas liked him. Sometimes she laughed even as she punished him.
And he was very polite. At the end of every day he would tell her, "Thank you for teaching me."
One day the students in Sister Mroslas's math class were feeling down. They were having a hard time understanding algebra.
Sister Mroslas tried to think of a way to make them feel better about themselves. She told students each to pull out a sheet of paper. On it, they wrote the names of all the other students in the class. Next to each name she told them to write something nice about that person.
Sister Mroslas collected the slips of paper. Later, she made a list for each student of the nice things their classmates had said about them. She handed the papers out during the next class.
Nine years later in 1971, Eklund died while serving as a soldier in Vietnam. Sister Mroslas went to his funeral. While she was there, Eklund's father showed her his son's wallet. In it was the piece of paper she had given him with his classmates' nice words on it.
Some of the other class members were also at the funeral. One after another, they revealed that they still had their pieces of paper, too. One person had put his in his wedding album. 
Another kept hers in her diary. Yet another kept his in his wallet just as Eklund had done.
"That's when I finally sat down and cried," Sister Mroslas said.

handful 难控制的人

赞扬的价值
1962年，莫罗斯修女在明尼苏达州莫里斯区的圣玛丽学校教书。
有个叫埃克伦的学生很难管，经常惹麻烦。但莫罗斯修女喜欢他，甚至惩罚他时，有时她还会笑。
而他很有礼貌。每天放学时，他会对莫罗斯修女说：“谢谢您的教导。”
有天，在莫罗斯修女的数学课上，学生情绪低落。他们在理解代数时遇到了困难。
莫罗斯修女尽力想办法让学生们对自己感觉好一些。她让学生每人拿出一张纸，在纸上写出班里所有学生的名字，在每个名字旁边写上这个同学的优点。
莫罗斯修女把纸条收上来。之后，她为每个学生做了一个单子，上面是其他人写的该同学的优点。再上课时，她把纸发了下去。
9年后的1971年，埃克伦作为一名士兵死于越南战争。莫罗斯修女参加了他的葬礼。她一到那里，埃克伦的父亲就让她看儿子的钱包，里面是她发的写有同学对其表扬的话的纸。
班里的其他同学有些也参加了葬礼。一个接一个，他们也透露自己仍保留着那张纸。有个学生把它放进了自己的婚礼纪念册。另一个把自己的收在日记中。还有一个像埃克伦一样放在钱包里。
“那时我终于坐下来哭了，”莫罗斯修女说.


Lesson58 A-level Disillusionment
　Anne Barrie's "Do We Over-educate Our Children?" reminded me that the German author Gunter Grass once said that failing his school leaving exams was a blessing without which he would never have achieved the position he now holds. I wonder how many other great men and women owe their success to having failed in their academic careers.
I was a schoolgirl in the 1960s - the time when it was believed that the future wealth of the country depended on the education of the young: money was plentiful, new universities sprang up and great myths evolved to lure young people into the academic life.
Three years later, I obtained a first-class degree in mathematics. For some months there had been pressure to try for a further degree - the more post-graduate students there are, the more financial benefits exist for us. My fellow postgraduates and I knew nothing of the outside world, and happily believed that academic life for another three years would enhance us in the eyes of future employers: and so I went to London and began work for a doctorate.
Here, for the first time, I came across "mature students" - people who had left school at 16 and, years later, taken A-levels at technical colleges and come to university. Having chosen their subject with great care, and being more mature, they found a joy in their courses unknown to most of us.
I have been working now for several years: life has been very different from what I had been led to expect. However, it is too late to change: the state of understanding will not pay to reeducate people completely. As I think back, I regret that I did not fail my A-levels.

disillusionment 幻灭, 觉醒    lure 引诱    doctorate 博士头衔

A''等级幻灭
　　安妮&#8226;巴瑞的《我们是不是给我们的孩子太多的教育了？》使我想到德国作家君特&#8226;格拉斯曾经说过的，他没有通过中学毕业考试是一件幸事，否则他就永远不可能取得现有的地位。不知道有多少其他伟人和名人们将所取得的成就归功于他们在学业上的失败。
　　60年代，我还是一名中学女生，那是一个认为国家未来的富足寄托于年轻人的教育的时代：资金充裕，不断有新的大学出现，教育神话的巨大诱惑使年轻人都追求学业上的成就。
　　3年后，我获得了数学的头等学位。好几个月里，我面临着研读更高学位的压力&&研究生越多，经济利益就会越多。我和我的研究生同学们丝毫不了解外面的世界，高枕无忧地认为学业上再深造三年能增加我们在未来老板眼里的价值。于是我到了伦敦，开始攻读博士学位。
　　在那里我第一次遇到了“成熟的学生”，他们十六岁就离开了学校，几年后在技术学院参加了A&等级课程考试，然后上了大学。他们的专业是经过深思熟虑后选择的，他们更成熟，能在所修的课程中获得大多数我们这样的学生无法体会到的乐趣。
现在我已经工作好几年了，现实生活和我们在学校的环境下所期待的样子完全不同。不过，现在做出改变已经太晚了，醒悟并不能给我们带来完全的再教育。回想起来，我真后悔当年没有让我的A&等级课程考试不及格。


Lesson59 Down with School!
　  School is an institution built on the axiom that learning is the result of teaching. And institutional wisdom continues to accept this axiom, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
Most learning happens casually, and even most intentional learning is not the result of programmed instruction. Normal children learn their first language casually, although faster if their parents pay attention to them. Most people who learn a second language well do so as a result of odd circumstances and not of sequential teaching. They go to live with their grandparents, they travel, or they fall in love with a foreigner. Fluency in reading is also more often than not a result of such extra-curricular activities. Most people read widely, and with pleasure out of school.
Everyone learns how to live outside school. We learn to speak, to think, to love, to feel, to play, to curse, to politick and to work without interference from a teacher. Even children who are under a teacher's care day and night are no exception to the rule. Orphans, idiots and schoolteachers' sons learn most of what they learn outside the "educational" process planned for them. Teachers have made a poor showing in their attempt at increasing learning among the poor. Poor parents who want their children to go to school are less concerned about what they will learn than about the certificate and money they will earn. And middle-class parents entrust their children to a teacher's care to keep them from learning what the poor learn on the streets. Increasingly, educational research demonstrates that children learn most of what teachers pretend to teach them from peer groups, from comics, from chance observations, and above all from mere participation in the ritual of school.

打倒学校！
　　学校是建立在学习是教学的结果这一理念基础上的机构。学院理论继续接受这一理念，尽管有压倒性的证据证明事实刚好相反。
　　大多数知识是在不经意间学来的。即便是有意的学习，大多也不是有组织教导的结果。正常的孩子随意地就学会了他们的母语，虽然如果父母用心的话，他们会学得更快些。大多数第二语言学得好的人是在特殊的环境下学成的，而不是系统教学所致。他们去和祖父母一起生活，去旅行，或者爱上一个外国人。阅读流畅也经常是课外阅读活动的结果，大多数人们在课外广泛地阅读，并且得到很多乐趣。
　　每个人都是在校外学会如何生活的。我们在没有老师干预的情况下，学会说话、思考、去爱、感受、玩、骂人、谈论政治和工作。即使是日夜处于老师照料下的孩子也无一例外地适用该规则。孤儿、白痴和老师的孩子学到的东西大多是从为他们设置的“教育”过程之外得来的。教师尝试提高穷人知识水平的努力乏善可陈。没钱的父母把他们的孩子送到学校，他们更关心孩子将来取得的证书和报酬，而不是孩子能学到什么。中产阶级的父母把孩子托付给老师，是为了不让他们学到穷人在街上学到的东西。教育研究日益显示，孩子们是从同龄人、漫画、偶尔的观察，及更重要的是学校的活动，学到了教师假装要教给他们的大多数东西。



Lesson60 Zen and the Art of Burglary
　  If people ask me what Zen is like, I will say that it is like learning the art of burglary. The son of a burglar saw his father growing older and thought, "If he is unable to carry on his profession, who will be the breadwinner of the family, except myself? I must learn the trade." He intimated the idea to his father, who approved of it.
One night the father took the son to a big house, broke through the fence, entered the house, and, opening one of the large chests, told the son to go in and pick out the clothing, as soon as the son get into it, the father dropped the lid and securely applied the lock. The father now came out to the courtyard and loudly knocked at the door, waking up the whole family; then he quietly slipped away by the hole in the fence. 
The residents got excited and lighted candles, but they found that the burglar had already gone.
The son, who remained all the time securely confined in the chest, thought of his cruel father. He was greatly mortified, then a fine idea flashed upon him. He made a noise like the gnawing of a rat. The family told the maid to take a candle and examine the chest. When the lid was unlocked, out came the prisoner, who blew out the light, pushed away the maid, and fled. The people ran after him. Noticing a well by the road, he picked up a large stone and threw it into the water. The pursuers all gathered around the well trying to find the burglars drowning himself in the dark hole.
In the meantime he went safely back to his father's house. He blamed his father deeply for this narrow escape. Said the father, "be not offended my son. Just tell me how you got out of it." When the son told him all about his adventures, the father remarked, "There you are, you have learned the art."

mortify 使丢脸，使经受羞辱   gnaw (用牙齿)咬，啃

禅宗与盗窃艺术
　　如果有人问我禅宗是什么，我会告诉他禅宗就像是盗窃艺术。窃贼的儿子看着他的父亲一天天变老，心想，“要是父亲不能继续他的行当，除了我之外还有谁能承担起养家糊口的重任呢？我要学会这门手艺。”他把自己的这个想法给父亲说了，父亲同意了。
　　一天晚上，父亲把儿子带到了一座大房子，钻过篱笆进入了房子。父亲打开一个大柜子，吩咐儿子进去偷些衣服出来。儿子刚进去，父亲就盖上了柜子的盖子，并牢牢地锁上了柜子。他来到院子里，大声地敲门，把这家人全给吵醒了。接着，父亲悄悄地从篱笆的洞里钻了出去。惊慌失措的这家人点亮了蜡烛，却发现窃贼已经跑掉了。
　　儿子一直被牢牢地锁在柜子里，想着他那无情的父亲。他感到受了屈辱。突然一个点子闪现在他的脑海中。他发出了老鼠咬柜子的声音，这家人就吩咐女仆拿着蜡烛去查看柜子。女仆一打开柜子的盖子，里面的躲着的人就跳了出来，吹灭蜡烛，推开女仆，逃走了。人们在后面追赶。他看到路边有一口井，搬起一块大石头，丢到了井里。追赶者都聚集在井边，想看看窃贼是不是掉进黑洞洞的井里淹死了。
　　这时候，他安全地回到了他父亲的房子。他斥责他父亲说他差点没能活着回来。父亲说，“儿呀，别生气，告诉我你怎么逃出来的。” 
听完儿子讲述了历险经历，父亲说，“现在好了，你已经学会了盗窃这门艺术。”
